Moreover, GSH, as an essential metabolite, is involved in the regulation of cell-redox homeostasis and proposed to scavenge cytotoxic free heme, which is released from hemoglobin of damaged red blood cells (RBCs) during different hemolytic disorders. In the present study, we aimed to uncover the molecular mechanism by which GSH inhibits hemin-induced cytotoxicity (HIC) by affecting hemin's structural integrity in K562 cells and in RBC hemolysates. GSH, along with other thiols (cysteine, thioglycolic acid, and mercaptoethanol) altered the spectrum of hemin, while each of them co-added with hemin in cultures of K562 cells prevented HIC and growth arrest and markedly reduced the intracellular level of hemin. In addition, GSH endogenous levels served as a barrier to HIC in K562 cells, as shown by the depletion in GSH. LC-MS/MS analysis of the in vitro reaction between hemin and GSH revealed at least five different isomers of GSH-hemin adducts, as well as hydroxy derivatives as reaction products, which are characterized by unique mass spectra (MS). The latter allowed the detection of adducts in human RBC hemolysates. Based on these findings, we proposed a molecular mechanism via which GSH prevents HIC and structurally disintegrates heme. An analogous reaction was observed in RBC hemolysates via direct inter-reaction between hematin (ferric and hydroxide heme) released from hemoglobin and GSH. Overall, GSH-hematin adducts could be considered as novel entities of the human metabolome of RBCs in hemolytic disorders.", "pmid": "36290682"}

The molecular basis whereby SARS-CoV2 may amplify Alzheimer's disease is not well understood. This study analyzed the molecular changes in autopsy brain tissues from people with pre-existing dementia who died of COVID-19 (n = 5) which was compared to equivalent tissues of people who died of COVID-19 with no history of dementia (n = 8), Alzheimer's disease pre-COVID-19 (n = 10) and aged matched controls (n = 10) in a blinded fashion. Immunohistochemistry analyses for hyperphosphorylated tau protein, alpha-synuclein, and beta-amyloid-42 confirmed the diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (n = 4), and Lewy body dementia (n = 1) in the COVID-19 group. The brain tissues from patients who died of COVID-19 with no history of dementia showed a diffuse microangiopathy marked by endocytosis of spike subunit S1 and S2 in primarily CD31+ endothelia with strong co-localization with ACE2, Caspase-3, IL6, TNFalpha, and Complement component 6 that was not associated with SARS-CoV2 RNA. Microglial activation marked by increased TMEM119 and MCP1 protein expression closely paralleled the endocytosed spike protein. The COVID-19 tissues from people with no pre-existing dementia showed, compared to controls, 5-10x fold increases in expression of neuronal NOS and NMDAR2 as well as a marked decrease in the expression of proteins whose loss is associated with worsening Alzheimer's disease: MFSD2a, SHIP1, BCL6, BCL10, and BACH1. In COVID-19 tissues from people with dementia the widespread spike-induced microencephalitis with the concomitant microglial activation co-existed in the same areas where neurons had hyperphosphorylated tau protein suggesting that the already dysfunctional neurons were additionally stressed by the SARS-CoV2 induced microangiopathy. ACE2+ human brain endothelial cells treated with high dose (but not vaccine equivalent low dose) spike S1 protein demonstrated each of the molecular changes noted in the in vivo COVID-19 and COVID-19/Alzheimer's disease brain tissues. It is concluded that fatal COVID-19 induces a diffuse microencephalitis and microglial activation in the brain due to endocytosis of circulating viral spike protein that amplifies pre-existing dementia in at least two ways: 1) modulates the expression of proteins that may worsen Alzheimer's disease and 2) stresses the already dysfunctional neurons by causing an acute proinflammatory/hypercoagulable/hypoxic microenvironment in areas with abundant hyperphosphorylated tau protein and/or betaA-42.", "pmid": "36334414"}

However, persistent rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury following discontinuation of statins require careful evaluation of the underlying causes to avoid missing a curable disease. We describe a 50-year-old woman with hypercholesterolemia [total cholesterol 345 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 266 mg/dL] on atorvastatin therapy (40 mg daily) for 1 month that presented with myalgia and muscle weakness. Relevant laboratory studies revealed persistent higher hypercholesterolemia with total cholesterol (312 mg/dL), high creatine kinase (CK) (5,178 U/L), and high creatinine levels (1.5 mg/dL) without dysmorphic red blood cells and proteinuria. Despite the cessation of statin therapy, serum CK level increased to 9,594 U/L, and creatinine remained at 1.5 mg/dL. A thorough work-up to assess potential underlying causes indicated low T3 and free T4 and high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, consistent with hypothyroidism. With aggressive thyroxine replacement for 1 month, all of the clinical features, along with elevated serum CK and creatinine levels, were completely resolved. This case highlights the fact that hypothyroidism must be kept in mind as a potential cause of concomitant myopathy and kidney injury, especially in patients with statin-resistant hypercholesterolemia.", "pmid": "36438056"}

The results showed that the Cd and Zn contents of B. juncea were mainly accumulated in the roots. The Cd content in the symplast sap was 127.66-146.50% higher than that in the apoplast sap, while the opposite was true for Zn. The distribution of Cd in xylem sap occupied 64.60% under 20 mg kg-1 Cd treatment, and Zn in xylem sap occupied 60.14% under 100 mg kg-1 Zn treatment. The Cd was predominantly distributed in the vacuole, but the Zn was predominantly distributed in the cell walls. In addition, oxalic and malic acids were present in high concentrations in B. juncea. In the vacuole, correlation analysis showed that the contents of Cd were negatively correlated with the contents of oxalic acid and succinic acid, and the contents of Zn were positively correlated with the contents of malic acid and acetic acid. The contents of Cd and Zn were negatively related to the contents of oxalic acid and citric acid in xylem sap. Therefore, Cd in B. juncea was mainly absorbed through the symplast pathway, and Zn was mainly absorbed through the apoplast pathway, and then Cd and Zn were distributed in the vacuole and cell walls.

One strategy by which tumor cells escape tight homeostatic control is by decreasing the expression of the potent anti-inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), also known as A20. We observed that tumor cell intrinsic loss of A20 markedly enhanced lung tumorigenesis and was associated with reduced CD8+ T cell-mediated immune surveillance in patients with lung cancer and in mouse models. In mice, we observed that this effect was completely dependent on increased cellular sensitivity to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling by aberrant activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and increased downstream expression and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Interrupting this autocrine feed forward loop by knocking out IFN-alpha/beta receptor completely restored infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and rescued loss of A20 depending tumorigenesis. Downstream of STAT1, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was highly expressed in A20 knockout lung tumors. Accordingly, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment was highly efficient in mice harboring A20-deficient lung tumors. Furthermore, an A20 loss-of-function gene expression signature positively correlated with survival of melanoma patients treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1. Together, we have identified A20 as a master immune checkpoint regulating the TBK1-STAT1-PD-L1 axis that may be exploited to improve ICB therapy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.", "pmid": "34233950"}

Totally 108 OSCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues from patients with OSCC were collected. Also, transplanted tumor formation experiment in nude mice was conducted to verify the effect of miR-433 and FAK on subcutaneous transplanted tumor. The CD44+ stem cell from SCC-9 were collected and assigned into the blank, miR-433 mimics, mimics control, miR-433 inhibitors, inhibitors control, siFAK and miR-433 inhibitors + siFAK groups. The qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to detect miR-433, FAK, ERK, MEK, pERK and pMEK after transfection. Flow cytometry, MTT assay, scratch test and Transwell assay were performed to determine the cell proportion, growth, migration and invasion of SCC-9 cells. In cell line SCC-9, expression of CD133, Oct-4, and BIM-1 was greater in CD44+ cells than CD44- cells, indicating that CD44+ cells had characteristics of tumor stem cells. Expression of FAK, ERK, MEK, p-ERK and p-MEK was decreased in tumor tissues from the CD44-, miR-433, and siFAK groups. Expression of MiR-433 mRNA was elevated, while levels of FAK, ERK, MEK, p-ERK, and p-MEK mRNA were all decreased in the miR-433 mimics group. In the miR-433 mimics and siFAK groups, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were all decreased, while the opposite trends were seen in the miR-433 inhibitor group.

However, the post-translational regulation of SNAI2 is less well studied. We performed a dual-luciferase-based, genome-wide E3 ligase siRNA library screen and identified ASB13 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets SNAI2 for ubiquitination and degradation. ASB13 knockout in breast cancer cells promoted cell migration and decreased F-actin polymerization, while overexpression of ASB13 suppressed lung metastasis. Furthermore, ASB13 knockout decreased YAP expression, and such regulation is dependent on an increased protein level of SNAI2, which in turn represses YAP transcription. YAP suppresses tumor progression in breast cancer, as YAP knockout increases tumorsphere formation, anchorage-independent colony formation, cell migration in vitro, and lung metastasis in vivo. Clinical data analysis reveals that ASB13 expression is positively correlated with improved overall survival in breast cancer patients. These findings establish ASB13 as a suppressor of breast cancer metastasis by promoting degradation of SNAI2 and relieving its transcriptional repression of YAP.", "pmid": "32943576"}

We evaluated the difference in terms of motor and sensory block, postoperative pain, and adverse effects during the first 24 h following delivery and neonatal outcome. Our study found that the sufentanil group had a significantly lower requirement for analgesia than the dexmedetomidine group. Postoperative pain, assessed with the VAS scale, was stronger in G1 than in G2 (4 +- 2 vs. 2 +- 1, p-value < 0.01).

This systematic review aimed to investigate cytokine levels in peripheral blood compartments and identify their potential immune cellular sources in subjects with autism through comparison with controls. We conducted an electronic database search (PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest Central, Ovid, SAGE Journals, and Wiley Online Library) from inception (no time limits) to July 9, 2020, and identified 75 relevant articles. Our qualitative data synthesis focused on results consistently described in at least three independent studies, and we reported the results according to the PRISMA protocol. We found that compared with controls, in subjects with autism, cytokines IL-6, IL-17, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta increased in the plasma and serum. We also identified monocytes, neutrophils, and CD4+ T cells as potential sources of these elevated cytokines in autism. Cytokines IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, RANTES, and IL-8 were increased in the plasma/serum of subjects with autism, and IFN-gamma was likely produced by CD4+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, although conflicting evidence is present for IFN-gamma and TGF-beta. Other cytokines-IL-13, IL-10, IL-5, and IL-4-were found to be unaltered in the plasma/serum and post-stimulated blood immune cells in autistic individuals as compared with controls. The frequencies of T cells, monocytes, B cells, and NK cells were unchanged in subjects with autism as opposed to controls, suggesting that abnormal cytokines were unlikely due to altered cell numbers but might be due to altered functioning of these cells in autism. Our results support existing studies of abnormal cytokines in autism and provide comprehensive evidence of potential cellular sources of these altered cytokines in the context of autism.

Most studies of DN have focused on a single or limited number of lipids, and the lipidome of the kidney during early-stage DN remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to comprehensively identify lipid abnormalities during early-stage DN; to this end, we established an early-stage DN rat model by feeding a high-sucrose and high-fat diet combined with administration of low-dose streptozotocin. Using a high-coverage, targeted lipidomic approach, we established the lipid profile, comprising 437 lipid species and 25 lipid classes, of the kidney cortex in normal rats and the DN rat model. Our findings additionally confirmed that the DN rat model had been successfully established. We observed distinct lipidomic signatures in the DN kidney, with characteristic alterations in side chain composition and degree of unsaturation. Glyceride lipids, especially cholesteryl esters, showed a significant increase in the DN kidney cortex. The levels of most phospholipids exhibited a decline, except those of phospholipids with side chain of 36:1. Furthermore, the levels of lyso-phospholipids and sphingolipids, including ceramide and its derivatives, were dramatically elevated in the present DN rat model. Our findings, which provide a comprehensive lipidome of the kidney cortex in rats with DN, are expected to be useful for the identification of pathologically relevant lipid species in DN.

Although the role of transgelin in cancer is controversial, a number of studies have shown that elevated levels correlate with aggressive tumor behavior, advanced stage, and poor prognosis. Here we sought to determine the role of transgelin more directly by determining whether experimental manipulation of transgelin levels in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells led to changes in metastatic potential in vivo. METHODS: Isogenic CRC cell lines that differ in transgelin expression were characterized using in vitro assays of growth and invasiveness and a mouse tail vein assay of experimental metastasis. Downstream effects of transgelin overexpression were investigated by gene expression profiling and quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Stable overexpression of transgelin in RKO cells, which have low endogenous levels, led to increased invasiveness, growth at low density, and growth in soft agar. Overexpression also led to an increase in the number and size of lung metastases in the mouse tail vein injection model. Similarly, attenuation of transgelin expression in HCT116 cells, which have high endogenous levels, decreased metastases in the same model. Investigation of mRNA expression patterns showed that transgelin overexpression altered the levels of approximately 250 other transcripts, with over-representation of genes that affect function of actin or other cytoskeletal proteins. Changes included increases in HOOK1, SDCCAG8, ENAH/Mena, and TNS1 and decreases in EMB, BCL11B, and PTPRD.

The dietary treatments included a basal diet as control (CON), a ZnO diet (basal diet + 1600 mg Zn/kg from ZnO), a Zn-Pro diet (basal diet + 60 mg Zn/kg from Zn-Pro), and a MRF plus Zn-Pro diet (MRP, basal diet + 800 mg/kg MRF + 60 mg Zn/kg from Zn-Pro). The average daily gain of piglets in the MRP group was higher (p <= 0.05) than that in CON and Zn-Pro groups during d 15-28 and d 1-28 of experiment. The apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein in the MRP group was higher (p <= 0.05) than that in the CON group. The serum insulin-like growth factor-1 level in the MRP group was markedly higher (p <= 0.05) than that of piglets in the other three treatment groups. Piglets fed the Zn-Pro and ZnO diets had greater (p <= 0.05) acetic acid in cecal digesta than those fed the CON diet, while the MRP diet had higher (p <= 0.05) cecal propionate concentration than those that were fed the CON diet on d 28 of experiment.

Early life stressful experiences might increase the risk of developing pathological aggressive behavior in adulthood, though molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we provide prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus specific transcriptome profiles of peripubertal stress (PPS) exposed Balb/c adult male mice exhibiting escalated aggression and adult female mice resilient to such aberrant behavioral responses. We identify transthyretin (TTR), a well known thyroid hormone transporter, as a key regulator of PPS induced escalated aggressive behavior in males. Brain region specific long-term changes in Ttr gene expression and thyroid hormone (TH) availability were evident in PPS induced escalated aggressive male mice, circulating TH being unaltered. Ttr promoter methylation marks were also altered being hypermethylated in hypothalamus and hypomethylated in prefrontal cortex corroborating with its expression pattern. Further, Ttr knockdown in hypothalamus resulted in escalated aggressive behavior in males without PPS and also reduced TH levels and expression of TH responsive genes (Nrgn, Trh and Hr). Escalated aggressive behavior along with reduced Ttr gene expression and TH levels in hypothalamus was also evident in next generation F1 male progenies.

Here we report that this suppression is induced by tumor microenvironment-derived factors, which activate the activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3) transcription factor and downregulate cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). Loss of CH25H in antigen presenting cells isolated from human lung tumors is associated with tumor growth and lung cancer progression. Accordingly, mice lacking CH25H in DCs exhibit an accelerated tumor growth, decreased infiltration and impaired activation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells. These mice do not establish measurable long-term immunity against malignant cells that undergo chemotherapy-induced immunogenic cell death. Mechanistically, downregulation of CH25H stimulates membrane fusion between endo-phagosomes and lysosomes, accelerates lysosomal degradation and restricts cross-presentation of tumor antigens in the intratumoral DCs. Administration of STING agonist MSA-2 reduces the lysosomal activity in DCs, restores antigen cross presentation, and increases therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 blockade against tumour challenge in a CH25H-dependent manner.

We hypothesized that brain nutrient signals such as amino acids and appetite-related neuropeptides synergistically regulate food intake. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the interaction between neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ornithine in the control of feeding behavior in chicks and the associated central and peripheral amino acid metabolic processes. Five-day-old chicks were intracerebroventricularly injected with saline, NPY (375 pmol), or NPY plus ornithine (2 or 4 mumol) at 10 mul per chick, and then subjected to ad libitum feeding conditions; food intake was monitored for 30 min after injection. Brain and plasma samples were collected after the experiment to determine free amino acid concentrations. Co-injection of NPY and ornithine significantly attenuated the orexigenic effect induced by NPY in a dose-dependent manner. Central NPY significantly decreased amino adipic acid, asparagine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and isoleucine levels, but significantly increased lysine levels in the brain. Co-injection of NPY and ornithine significantly increased ornithine and proline levels in all examined brain regions, but decreased diencephalic tryptophan and glycine levels compared with those of the control and NPY-alone groups. Co-injection of NPY and high-dose ornithine significantly decreased methionine levels in all brain regions. Central NPY significantly suppressed the plasma concentrations of amino acids, including proline, asparagine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, isoleucine, glycine, glutamine, alanine, arginine, and valine, and this reduction was greater when NPY was co-injected with ornithine. These results suggest that brain ornithine interacts with NPY to regulate food intake in neonatal chicks.

However, a comparative systematic analysis of the early impact of key soluble complement cleavage products, including anaphylatoxins, on neutrophil granulocyte function is lacking. Neutrophil activity was monitored by flow cytometry regarding cellular (electro-)physiology, cellular activity, and changes in the surface expression of activation markers. The study revealed no major effects induced by C3a or C4a on neutrophil functions. By contrast, exposure to C5a or C5a des-Arg stimulated neutrophil activity as reflected in changes in membrane potential, intracellular pH, glucose uptake, and cellular size. Similarly, C5a and C5a des-Arg but no other monitored complement cleavage product enhanced phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species generation. C5a and C5a des-Arg also altered the neutrophil surface expression of several complement receptors and neutrophil activation markers, including C5aR1, CD62L, CD10, and CD11b, among others. In addition, a detailed characterization of the C5a-induced effects was performed with a time resolution of seconds. The multiparametric response of neutrophils was further analyzed by a principal component analysis, revealing CD11b, CD10, and CD16 to be key surrogates of the C5a-induced effects.

CXCR2-targeted therapy has shown promising results in several solid tumors. However, the underlying mechanism of CXCR2-mediated cross-talk between gastric cancer cells and macrophages still remains unclear.Experimental Design: The expression of CXCR2 and its ligands in 155 human gastric cancer tissues was analyzed via immunohistochemistry, and the correlations with clinical characteristics were evaluated. A coculture system was established, and functional assays, including ELISA, transwell, cell viability assay, and qPCR, were performed to determine the role of the CXCR2 signaling axis in promoting gastric cancer growth and metastasis. A xenograft gastric cancer model and a lymph node metastasis model were established to study the function of CXCR2 in vivo. RESULTS: CXCR2 expression is associated with the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer (P = 0.002). Of all the CXCR2 ligands, CXCL1 and CXCL5 can significantly promote migration of gastric cancer cells. Macrophages are the major sources of CXCL1 and CXCL5 in the gastric cancer microenvironment, and promote migration of gastric cancer cells through activating a CXCR2/STAT3 feed-forward loop. Gastric cancer cells secrete TNF-alpha to induce release of CXCL1 and CXCL5 from macrophages. Inhibiting CXCR2 pathway of gastric cancer cells can suppress migration and metastasis of gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo.

The first aim of our pilot study was to determine the clinical potential of these excitability changes at symptom onset (P90-P105) in ALS via a novel non-invasive transcutaneous sDCS (tsDCS) treatment paradigm on un-anesthetized SOD1-G93A mice. The primary outcomes were motor function and survival. Unfortunately, skin damage avoidance limited the strength of applied stimulation intensity, likewise limiting measurable primary effects. The second aim of this study was to determine which orientation of stimulation (anodal vs cathodal, which are expected to have opposing effects) is beneficial vs harmful in ALS. Despite the lack of measured primary effects, strong trends in survival of the anodal stimulation group, combined with an analysis of survival variance and correlations among symptoms, suggest anodal stimulation is harmful at symptom onset. Therefore, cathodal stimulation may be beneficial at symptom onset if a higher stimulation intensity can be safely achieved via subcutaneously implanted electrodes or alternative methods. Importantly, the many logistical, physical, and stimulation parameters explored in developing this novel non-invasive treatment paradigm on unanesthetized mice provide insight into an appropriate and feasible methodology for future tsDCS study designs and potential clinical translation.", "pmid": "36134987"}
{"abstract_id": "519", "title": "The Histone Methyltransferase MLL1/KMT2A in Monocytes Drives Coronavirus-Associated Coagulopathy and Inflammation.", "abstract": "Coronavirus-associated coagulopathy (CAC) is a morbid and lethal sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CAC results from a perturbed balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis and occurs in conjunction with exaggerated activation of monocytes/macrophages (MO/Mphis) and the mechanisms that collectively govern this phenotype seen in CAC remain unclear. In this study, using experimental models that employ the murine betacoronavirus MHVA59, a well-established model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identify that the histone methyltransferase Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1 (MLL1/KMT2A) is an important regulator of MO/Mphi expression of procoagulant and profibrinolytic factors such as tissue factor (F3; TF), urokinase (PLAU), and urokinase receptor (PLAUR) (herein \"coagulopathy-related factors\") in non-infected and infected cells. We show that MLL1 concurrently promotes the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines while suppressing the expression of interferon a (IFNa), a well-known inducer of TF and PLAUR. Using in vitro models, we identify MLL1-dependent NFkappaB/RelA-mediated transcription of these coagulation-related factors and identify a context dependent MLL1-independent role for RelA in the expression of these factors in vivo. As functional correlates for these findings, we demonstrate that the inflammatory, procoagulant and profibrinolytic phenotypes seen in vivo after coronavirus infection were MLL1-dependent despite blunted Ifna induction in MO/Mphis. Finally, in an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 positive human samples, we identify differential upregulation of MLL1 and coagulopathy-related factor expression and activity in CD14+ MO/Mphis relative to non-infected and healthy controls. We also observed elevated plasma urokinase and TF activity in COVID-positive samples. Collectively, these findings highlight an important role for MO/Mphi MLL1 in promoting coronavirus-associated coagulopathy and inflammation.", "pmid": "36493338"}

It has also been linked to progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. OBJECTIVE: To study olfactory function and its associations with markers of AD brain pathology in non-demented mutation carriers of an autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) mutation and non-carrier family members. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 16 non-demented carriers of the Presenilin1 E280A ADAD mutation (mean age [SD]: 40.1 [5.3], and 19 non-carrier family members (mean age [SD]: 36.0 [5.5]) from Colombia, who completed olfactory and cognitive testing and underwent amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. RESULTS: Worse olfactory identification performance was associated with greater age in mutation carriers (r = -0.52 p = 0.037). In carriers, worse olfactory identification performance was related to worse MMSE scores (r = 0.55, p = 0.024) and CERAD delayed recall (r = 0.63, p = 0.007) and greater cortical amyloid-beta (r = -0.53, p = 0.042) and tau pathology burden (entorhinal: r = -0.59, p = 0.016; inferior temporal: r = -0.52, p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Worse performance on olfactory identification tasks was associated with greater age, a proxy for disease progression in this genetically vulnerable ADAD cohort. In addition, this is the first study to report olfactory dysfunction in ADAD mutation carriers with diagnosis of MCI and its correlation with abnormal accumulation of tau pathology in the entorhinal region. Taken together, our findings suggest that olfactory dysfunction has promise as an early marker of brain pathology and future risk for dementia.", "pmid": "35694921"}

Recently, a cyclic depsipeptide compound YM-254890 isolated from culture broth of Chromobacterium sp. was reported as a selective inhibitor for the Gq protein by blocking GDP exchange of GTP on the alpha subunit of Gq complex. However, functional selectivity of YM-254890 towards various G proteins was not fully characterized, primarily due to its restricted availability before 2017. Here, using human coronary artery endothelial cells as a model, we performed a systemic pharmacological evaluation on the functional selectivity of YM-254890 on multiple G protein-mediated receptor signaling. First, we confirmed that YM-254890, at 30 nM, abolished UTP-activated P2Y2 receptor-mediated Ca2+ signaling and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating its potent inhibition on the Gq protein. However, we unexpectedly found that YM-254890 also significantly suppressed cAMP elevation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by multiple Gs-coupled receptors including beta2-adrenegic, adenosine A2 and PGI2 receptors. Surprisingly, although YM-254890 had no impact on CXCR4/Gi/o protein-mediated suppression of cAMP production, it abolished ERK1/2 activation. Further, no cellular toxicity was observed for YM-254890, and it neither affected A23187- or thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ signaling, nor forskolin-induced cAMP elevation and growth factor-induced MAPK signaling. We conclude that YM-254890 is not a selective inhibitor for Gq protein; instead, it acts as a broad-spectrum inhibitor for Gq and Gs proteins and exhibits a biased inhibition on Gi/o signaling, without affecting non-GPCR-mediated cellular signaling.", "pmid": "33152337"}

VVS results from cerebral hypoperfusion, due to abnormal autonomic control of blood circulation, leading to arterial hypotension. It is a complex disease, and its development is largely associated with genetic susceptibility. Since abnormal neurohumoral regulation plays an important role in VVS development, we analyzed the association of VVS with polymorphic variants of ADRA1A, ADRB1, HTR1A, ADORA2A, COMT, and NOS3 genes, the products of which are involved in neurohumoral signaling, in patients with a confirmed VVS diagnosis (157 subjects) and individuals without a history of syncope (161 subjects). We were able to identify the associations between VVS and alleles/genotypes ADRA1A rs1048101, ADRB1 rs1801253, ADORA2A rs5751876, and COMT rs4680, as well as NOS3 rs2070744 in biallelic combination with COMT rs4680. Thus, we are the first to observe, within a single study, the role of the genes that encode alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, catechol-O-methyltransferase, adenosine receptors and nitric oxide synthase in VVS development. These findings demonstrate that the genes involved in neurohumoral signaling pathways contribute to the formation of a genetic susceptibility to VVS.", "pmid": "36140820"}

Methods: The human recombinant wild-type and mutant CRYAA (E156K) were constructed, and the molecular weight was measured by mass spectrometry. The structural changes induced by E156K mutation were analyzed by UV circular dichroism spectra and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and were predicted using Schrodinger software. The chaperone-like ability of wild-type and E156K mutant CRYAA was invested against the heat-induced aggregation of betaL-crystallin and the DTT-induced aggregation of insulin. HLECs expressing wild-type and mutated CRYAA were subjected to quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blot. Cell apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry analysis, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins were determined using western blot. Results: The mass spectrometric detection revealed that E156K mutation had no significant effect on the apparent molecular mass of the CRYAA oligomeric complex. Evaluation of the structures of the CRYAA indicated that E156K mutation did not significantly affect the secondary structures, while causing perturbations of the tertiary structure. The mutant CRYAA displayed an increase in chaperone-like activity, which might be related to the increase of the surface hydrophobicity. We also predicted that E156K mutation would induce a change from negatively charged surface to positively charged, which was the possible reason for the disturbance to the surface hydrophobicity. Transfection studies of HLECs revealed that the E156K mutant induced anti-apoptotic function in HLECs, which was possibly associated with the activation of the p-AKT signal pathway and downregulation of Casepase3. Conclusions: Taken together, our results for the first time showed that E156K mutation in CRYAA associated with ARC resulted in enhanced chaperone-like function by inducing its surface hydrophobicity, which was directly related to the activation of its anti-apoptotic function.", "pmid": "36338667"}

Whereas in the lateral amygdala the modulatory effect of capsaicin on long-term potentiation (LA-LTP) is mediated by TRPV1 channels, we have recently shown that capsaicin-induced enhancement of long term depression (LA-LTD) is mediated by TRPM1 receptors. However, the underlying mechanism by which capsaicin modulates synaptic plasticity is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate the modulatory effect of capsaicin on synaptic plasticity in mice lacking the AMPAR subunit GluA1. Capsaicin reduced the magnitude of LA-LTP in slices derived from wild-type mice as previously described, whereas this capsaicin-induced suppression was absent in GluA1-deficient mice. In contrast, neither LA-LTD nor the capsaicin-mediated enhancement of LA-LTD was changed in GluA1 knockout mice. Our data indicate that capsaicin-induced modulation of LA-LTP via TRPV1 involves GluA1-containing AMPARs whereas capsaicin-induced modulation of LA-LTD via TRPM1 is independent of the expression of the AMPAR GluA1 subunit.", "pmid": "29246976"}

Adolescents aged 12-21 years with eating disorders underwent postdose blood sampling in the fasted and/or fed state. NTX and primary active metabolite, 6-beta-naltrexol, were determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental analysis. DNA was genotyped for AKR1C4 missense mutations associated with decreased activity (rs3829125 and rs17134592). Linear mixed effects modeling was performed. In 21 participants, aged 16.9 +- 1.9 years (15-21 years), 81% female participants, maximum concentration (Cmax ) was 90.4 +- 129 nM/mg/kg, area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-  ) was 166 +- 154 nM h/mg/kg, and varied 63-fold and 21-fold, respectively.

This trial assessed the effectiveness of prednisolone and doxycycline based on eGFR changes at 6 months in patients with AIN of unknown aetiology. METHOD: A randomized clinical trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design for patients presenting with AIN of unknown aetiology (n = 59) was enacted to compare treatments with; A-prednisolone, B-doxycycline, C-both treatments together, and D-neither. The primary outcome was a recovery of patients' presenting renal function to eGFR categories: 61-90 ml/min/1.73m2 (complete remission- CR) to 31-60 ml/min/1.73m2 (partial remission- PR) and 0-30 ml/min/1.73m2 no remission (NR) by 6 months. A secondary outcome was progression-free survival (not reaching < 30 ml/min/1.73m2 eGFR), by 6-36 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: Seventy patients compatible with a clinical diagnosis of AIN were biopsied for eligibility; 59 AIN of unknown aetiology were enrolled, A = 15, B = 15, C = 14 and D = 15 randomly allocated to each group. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The number of patients with CR, PR and NR, respectively, by 6 months, in group A 3:8:2, group B 2:8:3 and group C 8:5:0 was compared with group D 8:6:1. There were no significant differences found between groups A vs. D (p = 0.2), B vs. D (p = 0.1) and C vs. D (p = 0.4). In an exploratory analysis, progression-free survival in prednisolone-treated (A + C) arms was 0/29 (100%) in comparison to 25/30 (83%) in those not so treated (B + D) arms, and the log-rank test was p = 0.02, whereas no such difference found (p = 0.60) between doxycycline-treated (B + C) arms 27/29 (93%) vs those not so treated (A + D) arms 27/30 (90%).

We aimed to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy versus 14-day metronidazole-intensified triple therapy for clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori infection with genotypic resistance. Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 782 patients with H. pylori infection examined using sequencing-based clarithromycin resistance point mutation tests were recruited between December 2018 and October 2020 in four institutions in Korea. Patients with significant point mutations (A2142G, A2142C, A2143G, A2143C, and A2144G) were randomly assigned to receive either 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy (n=102) or 14-day metronidazole-intensified triple therapy (n=99).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiology and Histology: Forty-six teeth with advanced carious lesions were radiographically investigated for intra-pulpal radiodense structures. Specimens were processed for histology and stained with haematoxylin/eosin and proteoglycan-specific stains. The intra-pulpal connective tissue was scored as pulp stones or ectopic connective tissue. Cell culture: pulpal cells from human third molars (n = 5) were cultured in chondrogenic medium +/- TLR2/4 agonists. Expression of the genes IL6, TLR2/4, SOX9, COL1A1, COL2A1, TGFB1, RUNX2 and ALPL was assessed by qPCR. Proteoglycan content within cultures was assessed spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: Radiodense structures were discovered in about half of all pulps. They were associated with ectopic connective tissue (chi2  = 8.932, p = .004, OR = 6.80, 95% CI: [1.84, 25.19]) and with pulp stones (chi2  = 12.274, df = 1, p < .001, OR = 22.167, 95% CI: [2.57, 200.00]). The morphology of the ectopic tissue resembled cartilage and was associated with inflammatory infiltration of the pulp (chi2  = 10.148, p = .002, OR = 17.77, 95% CI: [2.05, 154.21]). After continuous stimulation of cultured cells with TLR2/4 agonists, the expression of two inflammatory markers increased: IL6 at Days 7 (p = .020) and 14 (p = .008); TLR2 at Days 7 (p = .023) and 14 (p = .009). Similarly, expression of chondrogenic markers decreased: SOX9 at Day 14 (p = .035) and TGFB1 at Day 7 (p = .004), and the osteogenic marker COL1A1 at Day 7 (p = .007). Proteoglycan content did not differ between unstimulated and stimulated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Ectopic connective tissue resembling cartilage can form in teeth affected by advanced carious lesions. This tissue type is radiographically visible and is associated with inflammatory infiltration of the pulp. Although TLR2/4 agonists led to an inflammatory response in cell culture of pulp cells, the effect on the expression of osteogenic/chondrogenic markers was limited, suggesting that immune cells are needed for connective tissue formation in vivo.", "pmid": "36056458"}

Though less common than other kinds of irAEs, Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) related Isolated ACTH deficiency (IAD) may cause long-term damage to pituitary-adrenal axis. Several case reports are available about IAD during anti-PD-1 therapy. We report the first case of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced IAD following 3 month of sintilimab therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old Chinese man was diagnosed with stage IIIB lung adenocarcinoma with involving ipsilateral intrapulmonary and hilar lymph node metastasis. After 3 months of combination therapy of nedaplatin, pemetrexed and sintilimab, the patient presented with general fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Laboratory investigation at admission revealed hyponatremia and hypokalemia. Further investigation revealed adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels were far below than normal limits. His other pituitary hormone levels were normal, except for mild elevation of follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol. Cranic magnetic resonance imaging showed a normal pituitary gland. Isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency was diagnosed, and corticosteroid replacement therapy was administered, leading to a significant improvement of his symptoms while ACTH level maintaining low level. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient developed isolated ACTH deficiency during combination cancer treatment with chemotherapy and sintilimab. Although isolated ACTH deficiency due to anti-PD-1 including sintilimab therapy is rare occurrence, it can often cause severe clinical symptoms. Its diagnosis basically relies on clinical symptoms and endocrinological examination. Unlike traditional hypophysitis diagnosed by cranial MRI, pituitary MRI of IAD due to anti-PD-1 often indicates normal pituitary gland implying that over-reliance on imaging findings is not recommended. Even if clinical symptoms have relieved after corticosteroid replacement therapy was commenced, low levels of ACTH or cortisol could maintain for a long period which highlights the need for long term corticosteroid therapy.

Intestinal epithelial tight junction integrity, mucosal barrier function, microbiota dysbiosis, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, liver damage, and neuroinflammation were assessed. Corticosterone potentiated ethanol-induced epithelial tight junction disruption, mucosal permeability, and inflammatory response in GRDeltaHC mouse colon; these effects of ethanol and corticosterone were absent in GRDeltaIEC mice. Gut microbiota compositions in ethanol-fed GRDeltaHC and GRDeltaIEC mice were similar to each other. However, corticosterone treatment in ethanol-fed mice shifted the microbiota composition to distinctly different directions in GRDeltaHC and GRDeltaIEC mice. Ethanol and corticosterone synergistically elevated the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli and reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus in GRDeltaHC mice but not in GRDeltaIEC mice. In GRDeltaHC mice, corticosterone potentiated ethanol-induced endotoxemia and systemic inflammation, but these effects were absent in GRDeltaIEC mice. Interestingly, ethanol-induced liver damage and its potentiation by corticosterone were observed in GRDeltaHC mice but not in GRDeltaIEC mice. GRDeltaIEC mice were also resistant to ethanol- and corticosterone-induced inflammatory response in the hypothalamus.

The results of potentiodynamic and potentiostatic measurements showed that the Pt-Cu/C electrocatalyst has higher ethanol oxidation efficiency and incomplete ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde and acetic acid prevails under the given conditions. After calibration of the m/z = 44 mass signal, the CO2 current efficiencies on Pt/C and PtCu-3/C were ~7% and ~12%, respectively, which reveal that the presence of copper enhances the complete ethanol oxidation to CO2.", "pmid": "36605655"}
{"abstract_id": "535", "title": "New panel of biomarkers to discriminate between amelanotic and melanotic metastatic melanoma.", "abstract": "Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that can rapidly invade distant organs. A distinctive feature of melanomas is their pigmentation status, as melanin is present in most skin melanomas, whilst many metastatic tumors could become amelanotic. Besides the obvious malfunction of the key genes of the melanin pathway, the amelanotic tumors could bear a characteristic molecular signature accounting for their aggressivity. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics we report here a distinctive panel of biomarkers for amelanotic aggressive melanoma that differ from the less invasive pigmented cells. The developed method allows the label-free quantification of proteins identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. We found a set of proteins comprising AHNAK, MYOF, ANXA1, CAPN2, ASPH, EPHA2, THBS1, TGM2, ACTN4 along with proteins involved in cell adhesion/migration (integrins, PLEC, FSCN1, FN1) that are highly expressed in amelanotic melanoma. Accompanying the down regulation of pigmentation specific proteins such as tyrosinase and TYRP1, these biomarkers are highly specific for a type of highly invasive melanoma. Interestingly, the LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis in hypoxia revealed that the abundance of this specific set of proteins found in normoxia was rather unaltered in these conditions. These biomarkers could therefore predict a metastatic behaviour for the amelanotic cells in the early stages of the tumor development and thus serve in melanoma prognostic. Applying this algorithm to related databases including melanoma samples published by independent laboratories/public databases we confirm the specificity of the newly found signatures. Overall, we begin to unravel the molecular alterations in the amelanotic melanoma and how basic proteomics offers insights into how to assess the clinical, pathological and misdiagnosis differences between the main subtypes of melanoma.", "pmid": "36776379"}

Rodent models suggest that adequate cleavage of ACTH to alpha-melanocortin-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and desacetyl-alpha-melanocortin-stimulating hormone (d-alpha-MSH) by prohormone convertase 2 at the KKRR region is required for regulating food intake and energy balance. METHODS: We present 2 sisters with a novel POMC gene variant, leading to an ACTH defect at the prohormone convertase 2 cleavage site, and performed functional studies of this variant. RESULTS: The patients had obesity, hyperphagia and hypocortisolism, with markerly raised levels of ACTH but unaffected pigmentation. Their ACTH has reduced potency to stimulate the melanocortin (MC) 2 receptor, explaining their hypocortisolism. CONCLUSION: The hyperphagia and obesity support evidence that adequate cleavage of ACTH to alpha-MSH and d-alpha-MSH is also required in humans for feeding control.", "pmid": "35737586"}

Although the molecular mechanisms underlying IS remain unclear, ferroptosis was shown to play an important role in its pathogenesis. Hence, we applied bioinformatics analysis to identify ferroptosis-related therapeutic targets in IS. IS-related microarray data from the GSE61616 dataset were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and intersected with the FerrDb database. In total, 33 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained and subjected to functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses. Four candidate genes enriched in the HIF-1 signaling pathway (HMOX1, STAT3, CYBB, and TLR4) were selected based on the hierarchical clustering of the PPI dataset. We also downloaded the IR-related GSE35338 dataset and GSE58294 dataset from the GEO database to verify the expression levels of these four genes. ROC monofactor analysis demonstrated a good performance of HMOX1, STAT3, CYBB, and TLR4 in the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. Transcriptional levels of the above four genes, and translational level of GPX4, the central regulator of ferroptosis, were verified in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced IS by qRT-PCR and western blotting. Considering the regulation of the HIF-1 signaling pathway, dexmedetomidine was applied to the MCAO mice. We found that expression of these four genes and GPX4 in MCAO mice were significantly reduced, while dexmedetomidine reversed these changes. In addition, dexmedetomidine significantly reduced MCAO-induced cell death, improved neurobehavioral deficits, and reduced the serum and brain levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and oxidative stress mediators (MDA and GSSG). Further, we constructed an mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA network based on the four candidate genes and predicted possible transcription factors. In conclusion, we identified four ferroptosis-related candidate genes in IS and proposed, for the first time, a possible mechanism for dexmedetomidine-mediated inhibition of ferroptosis during IS. These findings may help design novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of IS.", "pmid": "36506580"}

While patients treated with osimertinib show clinical benefit, disease progression and drug resistance are common. Emergence of de novo acquired resistance from a drug tolerant persister (DTP) cell population is one mechanism proposed to explain progression on osimertinib and other targeted cancer therapies. Here we profiled osimertinib DTPs using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to characterize the features of these cells and performed drug screens to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities. We identified several vulnerabilities in osimertinib DTPs that were common across models, including sensitivity to MEK, AURKB, BRD4, and TEAD inhibition. We linked several of these vulnerabilities to gene regulatory changes, for example, TEAD vulnerability was consistent with evidence of Hippo pathway turning off in osimertinib DTPs. Last, we used genetic approaches using siRNA knockdown or CRISPR knockout to validate AURKB, BRD4, and TEAD as the direct targets responsible for the vulnerabilities observed in the drug screen.", "pmid": "36575215"}

This report presents the first case of VHL disease complicated with CRVO caused by VHL c.208G > A mutation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20 s man whose left eye visual acuity gradually declined for half a year. The visual acuity of the left eye is counting fingers. Fundus examination revealed that retinal hemangioblastoma was also found in addition to typical CRVO signs such as tortuous expansion of retinal veins and flame-shaped hemorrhage of the retina. Liver tumor, cerebral infarction and erythrocytosis were found during systemic examination, and the diagnosis of polycythemia was confirmed by bone marrow smear. Furthermore, both family history and genetic analysis indicated that the patient had VHL disease caused by VHL c.208G > A. In this patient, a large number of bone marrow erythrocytes proliferated due to VHL disease, which led to the increase of blood viscosity and erythrocyte vascular adhesion, resulting in the obstruction of central retinal vein blood flow, and finally CRVO. For CRVO and its pathogenic factor polycythemia, patient received laser retinal photocoagulation and phlebotomies. After a 1-year follow-up, the vision in the left eye improved to 0.2 logMAR. CONCLUSIONS: This is a rare case of polycythemia complicated by CRVO in patient with VHL disease. It reminds us that the systemic disease factors should be fully considered in the diagnosis of young patients with CRVO, and that treatment requires a coordinated effort of physicians.", "pmid": "36384467"}

We hypothesized that the relationship between lipids and AMD may also differ according to CS genotype profile. Thus, the objective was to investigate the relationships between lipid-related metabolites and AMD according to CS genotypes. Design: Population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 6947 participants from Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study with complete relevant data were included. Methods: We investigated a total of 32 blood lipid-related metabolites from nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics data including lipoproteins and their subclasses, cholesterols, glycerides, and phospholipids, as well as 4 CS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs10922109 (complement factor H), rs10033900 (complement factor I), rs116503776 (C2-CFB-SKIV2L), and rs2230199 (C3). We first investigated the associations between AMD and the 32 lipid-related metabolites using multivariable logistic regression models. Then, to investigate whether the effect of lipid-related metabolites on AMD differ according to the CS SNPs, we tested the possible interactions between the CS SNPs and the lipid-related metabolites. Main Outcome Measures: Age-related macular degeneration was defined using the Wisconsin grading system. Results: Among the 6947 participants, the prevalence of AMD was 6.1%, and the mean age was 58.3 years. First, higher levels of cholesterol in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and medium and large HDL particles were associated with an increased risk of AMD, and higher levels of serum total triglycerides (TG) and several very-low-density lipoprotein subclass particles were associated with a decreased risk of AMD. Second, these lipids had significant interaction effects on AMD with 2 CS SNPs: rs2230199 and rs116503776 (after correction for multiple testing). For rs2230199, in individuals without risk allele, higher total cholesterol in HDL2 was associated with an increased AMD risk (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation increase, 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.37; P = 0.005), whereas, in individuals with at least 1 risk allele, higher levels of these particles were associated with a decreased AMD risk (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.45-1.05; P = 0.079). Conversely, for rs116503776, in individuals without risk allele, higher serum total TG were associated with a decreased AMD risk (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.95; P = 0.005), whereas, in individuals with 2 risk alleles, higher levels of these particles were associated with an increased risk of AMD (OR, 2.3, 95% CI, 0.99-5.39, P = 0.054). Conclusions: Lipid-related metabolites exhibit opposite directions of effects on AMD according to CS genotypes.

Our initial screen of a collection of natural products from Danshen led to the identification of tanshinones as the potent and selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibitors. To improve the druggability and explore the structure-activity relationships (SARs), more than 40 derivatives have been designed and synthesized using tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone as the starting materials. More than 10 derivatives exhibited potent in vitro 11beta-HSD1 inhibitory activity and good selectivity over 11beta-HSD2 across human and mouse species. Based on the biological results, SARs were further discussed, which was also partially rationalized by a molecular docking model of 1 bound to the 11beta-HSD1. Remarkably, compounds 1, 17 and 30 significantly inhibited 11beta-HSD1 in 3T3-L1 adipocyte and in livers of ob/ob mice, which merits further investigations as anti-diabetic agents.

Liver and kidney functions were significantly reduced in the piroxicam group compared with control. Liver and kidney tissues were damaged in the piroxicam group while they appeared more or less normal in the SB group. The expression of inflammatory genes was significantly up-regulated in the liver and kidney tissues of the piroxicam group compared to the control group. The expression of anti-inflammatory genes was significantly down-regulated in the liver and kidney of the piroxicam group and up-regulated in the liver and kidney of the SB group compared to the control group.

Several potent FGFR4-selective inhibitors have been developed but have exhibited limited efficacy in HCC clinical trials. Here, by using HCC cell line models from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the Liver Cancer Model Repository (LIMORE), we show that selective FGFR4 inactivation was not sufficient to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in FGF19-positive HCC. Moreover, genetic inactivation of KLB in these HCC cells resulted in a fitness defect more severe than that resulting from inactivation of FGFR4. By a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, we found that KLB associated with FGFR3 and FGFR4 to mediate the prosurvival functions of FGF19. KLB mutants defective in interacting with FGFR3 or FGFR4 could not support the growth or survival of HCC cells. Genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screening revealed that FGFR3 restricted the activity of FGFR4-selective inhibitors in inducing cell death; the pan-FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib displayed superior potency than FGFR4-selective inhibitors in suppressing the growth and survival of FGF19-positive HCC cells. Among FGF19-positive HCC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), FGFR3 is prevalently coexpressed with FGFR4 and KLB, suggesting that FGFR redundancy may be a common mechanism underlying the de novo resistance to FGFR4 inhibitors. Our study provides a rationale for clinical testing of pan-FGFR inhibitors as a treatment strategy for FGF19-positive HCC.", "pmid": "36179047"}

Here, we aim to characterize the integrative control of intracellular catecholamine for subcellular beta1AR signaling and cardiac function. Using anchored Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors and transgenic mice, we determined the regulation of compartmentalized beta1AR-PKA signaling at the SR and plasma membrane (PM) microdomains by organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), two critical modulators of catecholamine uptake and homeostasis. Additionally, we examined local PKA substrate phosphorylation and excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocyte. Cardiac-specific deletion of MAO-A (MAO-A-CKO) elevates catecholamines and cAMP levels in the myocardium, baseline cardiac function, and adrenergic responses. Both MAO-A deletion and inhibitor (MAOi) selectively enhance the local beta1AR-PKA activity at the SR but not PM, and augment phosphorylation of phospholamban, Ca2+ cycling, and myocyte contractile response. Overexpression of MAO-A suppresses the SR-beta1AR-PKA activity and PKA phosphorylation. However, deletion or inhibition of OCT3 by corticosterone prevents the effects induced by MAOi and MAO-A deletion in cardiomyocytes. Deletion or inhibition of OCT3 also negates the effects of MAOi and MAO-A deficiency in cardiac function and adrenergic responses in vivo. Our data show that MAO-A and OCT3 act in concert to fine-tune the intracellular SR-beta1AR-PKA signaling and cardiac fight-or-flight response.

In earlier work on this subject, we documented that coal dust (CD) nanoparticles (CD-NPs) induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF) more profoundly than did CD micron particles (CD-MPs), but the mechanism has not been thoroughly studied. Based on the GEO database, jveen, STRING, and Cytoscape tools were used to screen hub genes regulating PF. Particle size distribution of CD were analyzed with Malvern nanoparticle size potentiometer. Combining 8 computational methods, we found that IGF1, POSTN, MMP7, ASPN, and CXCL14 may act as hub genes regulating PF. Based on the high score of IGF1 and its important regulatory role in various tissue fibrosis, we selected it as the target gene in this study. Activation of the IGF1/IGF1R axis promoted CD-NPs-induced PF, and inhibition of the axis activation had the opposite effect in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, activation of the IGF1/IGF1R axis induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) to accelerate PF. High-throughput gene sequencing based on lung tissue suggested that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and the NF-kB signaling pathway play a key role in PF. Also, ROS induced inflammation and EMT by the activation of the NF-kB/NLRP3 axis to accelerate PF. ROS can induce the activation of AKT/GSK3beta signaling, and inhibition of it can inhibit ROS-induced inflammation and EMT by the NF-kB/NLRP3 axis, thereby inhibiting PF. CD-NPs induced PF by promoting inflammation and EMT via the NF-kappaB/NLRP3 pathway driven by IGF1/ROS-mediated AKT/GSK3beta signals.

We aimed to evaluate first-line programmed cell death (PD)-1 inhibitor-based therapies in gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. We report the first results for nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (CheckMate 649), we enrolled adults (>=18 years) with previously untreated, unresectable, non-HER2-positive gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, or oesophageal adenocarcinoma, regardless of PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression from 175 hospitals and cancer centres in 29 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1 while all three groups were open) via interactive web response technology (block sizes of six) to nivolumab (360 mg every 3 weeks or 240 mg every 2 weeks) plus chemotherapy (capecitabine and oxaliplatin every 3 weeks or leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin every 2 weeks), nivolumab plus ipilimumab, or chemotherapy alone. Primary endpoints for nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone were OS or progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review, in patients whose tumours had a PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) of five or more. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02872116. FINDINGS: From March 27, 2017, to April 24, 2019, of 2687 patients assessed for eligibility, we concurrently randomly assigned 1581 patients to treatment (nivolumab plus chemotherapy [n=789, 50%] or chemotherapy alone [n=792, 50%]). The median follow-up for OS was 13 1 months (IQR 6 7-19 1) for nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 11 1 months (5 8-16 1) for chemotherapy alone. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy resulted in significant improvements in OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0 71 [98 4% CI 0 59-0 86]; p<0 0001) and PFS (HR 0 68 [98 % CI 0 56-0 81]; p<0 0001) versus chemotherapy alone in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of five or more (minimum follow-up 12 1 months). Additional results showed significant improvement in OS, along with PFS benefit, in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of one or more and all randomly assigned patients. Among all treated patients, 462 (59%) of 782 patients in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and 341 (44%) of 767 patients in the chemotherapy alone group had grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events. The most common any-grade treatment-related adverse events (>=25%) were nausea, diarrhoea, and peripheral neuropathy across both groups. 16 (2%) deaths in the nivolumab plus chemotherapy group and four (1%) deaths in the chemotherapy alone group were considered to be treatment-related. No new safety signals were identified. INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab is the first PD-1 inhibitor to show superior OS, along with PFS benefit and an acceptable safety profile, in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in previously untreated patients with advanced gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction, or oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Nivolumab plus chemotherapy represents a new standard first-line treatment for these patients. FUNDING: Bristol Myers Squibb, in collaboration with Ono Pharmaceutical.", "pmid": "34102137"}

Previous work has focused on acute kidney tubular injury induced by cisplatin, whereas the chronic sequelae post-injury has not been well-explored. In the present study, we established a kidney fibroblast model of CKD induced by repeated administration of cisplatin (RAC) as a clinically relevant model. In NRK-49F rat kidney fibroblasts, RAC upregulated alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and fibronectin proteins, suggesting that RAC induces kidney fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation. RAC also enhanced cell size, including the cell attachment surface area, nuclear area, and cell volume. Furthermore, RAC induced p21 expression and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, suggesting that kidney fibroblasts exposed to RAC develop a senescent phenotype. Inhibition of p21 reduced cellular senescence, hypertrophy, and myofibroblast transformation induced by RAC. Intriguingly, after RAC, kidney fibroblasts were arrested at the G2/M phase. Repeated treatment with paclitaxel as an inducer of G2/M arrest upregulated p21, alpha-SMA, and fibronectin in the kidney fibroblasts.

In the present study, we used a bioinformatics approach to examine expression profiles of CDH family genes using the Oncomine, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2), cBioPortal, MetaCore, and Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER) platforms. We revealed that CDH1/2/4/11/12/13 messenger (m)RNA levels are overexpressed in breast cancer cells compared to normal cells and were correlated with poor prognoses in breast cancer patients' distant metastasis-free survival. An enrichment analysis showed that high expressions of CDH1/2/4/11/12/13 were significantly correlated with cell adhesion, the extracellular matrix remodeling process, the EMT, WNT/beta-catenin, and interleukin-mediated immune responses.

The median age of onset of symptoms was 12 months (range, 4 months-4 years), while the age at diagnosis ranged from 2.3 to 26 years. The classic triad of arthritis, dermatitis, and uveitis was present in 6/11 (54.5%) patients. The frequency of arthritis, dermatitis, and uveitis was 100%, 81.8%, and 72.7%, respectively. The median age at diagnosis of ocular symptoms was 4 years (range, 2-26 years). Family history was noted in six families. Renal involvement was observed in two children. All patients in our cohort had the R334W variant in NOD2 gene. An asymptomatic carrier sibling with R334W mutation was identified in one family. Methotrexate was used as a first-line agent in all children. Adalimumab, which was commenced in five patients with uveitis, resulted in significant improvement in four patients. The total follow-up duration of the present cohort is 1,063.8 patient-months. Conclusions: The possibility of BS should always be considered in patients with arthritis and early ocular involvement. Uveitis is often progressive and refractory to currently available therapies. Systemic involvement appears to remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.", "pmid": "36189202"}

Whether the growth-promoting effect of Trp is due to the improvement in nutrient transport and absorption during weaning or under conditions of inflammation has not been fully characterized. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of Trp on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced changes in glucose and amino acid (AA) transport in the rat jejunum. Twenty-four 7-week-old Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into one of three groups: control, LPS, and Trp + LPS. Rats were supplemented with 0 or 0.1 mg Trp per gram body weight/d in drinking water for 7 days and were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (5 mg/kg BW) on day 8. After 24 h, rats were sacrificed, and jejunum samples were isolated for the analysis of glucose and AA transport using an Ussing chamber and the expression of glucose and AA transporters. The results showed that Trp alleviated the LPS-induced increase in jejunal permeability (p < 0.05) and decrease in changes in the short-circuit current of glucose, arginine, glutamine, glutamate, glycine, histidine, leucine, lysine, taurine, threonine, and Trp (p < 0.05). Trp reversed (p < 0.05) the LPS-induced downregulation of expression of the glucose transporter SGLT1 and AA transporters solute carrier family 38 member 2 (SNAT2) and solute carrier family 7 member 8 (LAT2), as well as ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 2 (ATP1A2). However, Trp increased (p < 0.01) the LPS-induced upregulation of acidic AA transporter solute carrier family 1 member 1 (EAAT3) expression. The above findings may help to develop nutritional interventions for the differential targeting of gut nutrient transporters, aiming to improve gut function and health in the presence of inflammation in both humans and animals.", "pmid": "36359168"}

We investigated the anti-chemoresistance characteristics of diallyl trisulfide (DATS) in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo. Previous preclinical studies have revealed that DATS regulates distinct hallmark cancer-signaling pathways. The cell cycle pathway is the most investigated signaling pathway in DATS. Additionally, post-DATS treatment has been found to promote proapoptotic capacity through the regulation of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway components. In the present study, we found that treating cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant ovarian cell lines with DATS inhibited their proliferation and reduced their IC50. It induced cell apoptosis and promoted oxidative phosphorylation through the regulation of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC1alpha pathway, OXPHOS, and enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity. DATS treatment alleviated glutamine consumption in cisplatin-resistant cells. Our findings highlight the role of DATS in overcoming drug resistance in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo.

Kelulut honey (KH) has been shown to be beneficial in PCOS-induced rats by regulating folliculogenesis and the oestrus cycle. However, no study has been conducted to evaluate KH's effect on sex steroid receptors in PCOS. Therefore, the current study examined the effects of KH, metformin, or clomiphene alone and in combination on the mRNA expression and protein distribution of androgen receptor (AR), oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), oestrogen receptor beta (ERbeta), and progesterone receptor (PR) in PCOS-induced rats. The study used female Sprague-Dawley rats, which were treated orally with 1 mg/kg/day of letrozole for 21 days to develop PCOS. PCOS-induced rats were then divided and treated orally for 35 days with KH, metformin, clomiphene, KH + metformin, KH+ clomiphene and distilled water. In this study, we observed aberrant AR, ERalpha, ERbeta and PR expression in PCOS-induced rats compared with the normal control rats. The effects of KH treatment were comparable with clomiphene and metformin in normalizing the expression of AR, ERalpha, and ERbeta mRNA. However, KH, clomiphene and metformin did not affect PR mRNA expression and protein distribution. Hence, this study confirms the aberrant expression of sex steroid receptors in PCOS and demonstrates that KH treatment could normalise the sex steroid receptors profile. The findings provide a basis for future clinical trials to utilize KH as a regulator of sex steroid receptors in patients with PCOS.", "pmid": "36499085"}

Recently, a long-tail hotspot mutation targeting the R-RAS2/TC21 Gln72 residue (Q72L) was identified as a potent oncogenic driver. Additional point mutations were also found in other tumors at low frequencies. Despite this, little information is available regarding the transforming role of these mutant versions and their relevance for the tumorigenic properties of already-transformed cancer cells. Here, we report that many of the RRAS2 mutations found in human cancers are highly transforming when expressed in immortalized cell lines. Moreover, the expression of endogenous R-RAS2Q72L is important for maintaining optimal levels of PI3K and ERK activities as well as for the adhesion, invasiveness, proliferation, and mitochondrial respiration of ovarian and breast cancer cell lines. Endogenous R-RAS2Q72L also regulates gene expression programs linked to both cell adhesion and inflammatory/immune-related responses. Endogenous R-RAS2Q72L is also quite relevant for the in vivo tumorigenic activity of these cells. This dependency is observed even though these cancer cell lines bear concurrent gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding RAS signaling elements. Finally, we show that endogenous R-RAS2, unlike the case of classical RAS proteins, specifically localizes in focal adhesions. Collectively, these results indicate that gain-of-function mutations of R-RAS2/TC21 play roles in tumor initiation and maintenance that are not fully redundant with those regulated by classical RAS oncoproteins.", "pmid": "36476833"}

The MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway is maintained active in the IS by testicular luminal factors and plays crucial roles in the maintenance and differentiation of the IS epithelium. Tight junctions (TJs) are constituents of the blood-epididymis barrier, which mediates the paracellular transport of ions, solutes, and water and controls epithelial cell differentiation, thereby contributing to the establishment of a unique luminal environment. We examine here the role of the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway in the regulation of TJ proteins in the IS. Inhibition of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK or MEK1/2) with PD325901, followed by reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK), decreased zonula occludens (ZO)-2 expression and increased ZO-3 expression in TJs but had no effect on ZO-1 expression. In control mice, in addition to being located in TJs, claudin (Cldn)-1, Cldn-3, and Cldn-4 were detected in the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, with enriched expression of Cldn-1 and Cldn-4 in basal cells. PD325901 reduced the expression of Cldn-1 and Cldn-4 at all locations without affecting Cldn-3. Occludin was undetectable in the IS of control mice, but PD325901 triggered its expression in TJs. No effect was observed for any of the proteins examined in the other epididymal regions.

Previously, documentation of patient experiences during emergencies often comes years after the fact, in part because there is a substantial data void in real-time. Methods: We extracted 308 posts that mention COVID-19 keywords on r/methadone, an online community for patients receiving MMT to share information, on Reddit occurring between January 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020. 215 of these posts self-report an impact to their MMT. Using qualitative content analysis, we characterized the impacts described in these posts and identified four emergent themes describing patients' experience of impacts to MMT during COVID-19. Results: The themes included (1) 54.4% of posts reporting impediments to accessing their methadone, (2) 28.4% reporting impediments to accessing physicial OTPs, (3) 19.5% reporting having to self-manage their care, and (4) 4.7% reporting impediments to accessing OTP providers and staff. Conclusions: Patients described unanticipated consequences to one-size-fits-all policies that are unevenly applied resulting in suboptimal dosing, increased perceived risk of acquiring COVID-19 at OTPs, and reduced interaction with OTP providers and staff. While preliminary, these results are formative for follow-up surveillance metrics for patients of OTPs as well as digitally-mediated resource needs for this online community.

Methods: The real-time qRT-PCR (to analyze IGF-1R gene expression), the immunohistochemistry (to measure IGF-1R protein), and the ELISA assay (to assess the circulating level of IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3) were applied to confirm this hypothesis. A total number of 180 bone tissues (90 tumors and 90 noncancerous adjacent tissues) and 120 blood samples drained from 90 patients with bone tumors and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The association of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 axis expression pattern with the patient's clinical pathological characteristics and tumor aggressive features, the diagnostic and predictive values were assessed for all tumor groups. Results: A significantly elevated level of IGF-1R gene and protein was detected in bone tumors compared to the noncancerous bone tissues that were prominent in osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma compared to the GCT group. The positive association of the IGF-1R gene and protein level with tumor grade, metastasis, and recurrence was detected in the osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma groups.

Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important modulators of ketamine's antidepressant effect. We investigated the alteration in miR-29b-3p in the brain of rats subjected to ketamine administration and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), and a sucrose preference test and forced swimming test were used to evaluate the rats' depressive-like state. We used recombination adeno-associated virus (rAAV) or lentivirus-expressing miR-29b-3p to observe the change in metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (GRM4). Cell culture and electrophysiological recordings were used to evaluate the function of miR-29b-3p. Ketamine dramatically increased miR-29b-3p expression in the prefrontal cortex of the normal rats. The dual luciferase reporter test confirmed that GRM4 was the target of miR-29b-3p. The miR-29b-3p levels were downregulated, while the GRM4 levels were upregulated in the prefrontal cortex of the depressive-like rats. The ketamine treatment increased miR-29b-3p expression and decreased GRM4 expression in the prefrontal cortex of the depressive-like rats and primary neurons. By overexpressing and silencing miR-29b-3p, we further validated that miR-29b-3p could negatively regulate GRM4. The silencing of miR-29b-3p suppressed the Ca2+ influx in the prefrontal cortex neurons. The miR-29b-3p overexpression contributed to cell survival, cytodendrite growth, increases in extracellular glutamate concentration, and cell apoptosis inhibition. The overexpression of miR-29b-3p by rAAV resulted in a noticeable relief of the depressive behaviors of the CUMS rats and a lower expression of GRM4. The miR-29b-3p/GRM4 pathway acts as a critical mediator of ketamine's antidepressant effect in depressive-like rats and could be considered a potential therapeutic target for treating major depression disorder.", "pmid": "30369596"}

In the present study, Fischer-344 rats were fed a choline-deficient (CDAA, cancer group) or choline-sufficient (CSAA, healthy group) L-amino acid-defined diet. At the end of 52 weeks, transcriptomic alterations in livers of rats with HCC tumours and healthy livers were investigated by RNA sequencing. DNA methylation and gene expression were assessed by pyrosequencing and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), respectively. We discovered 1,848 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in livers of rats with HCC tumours (CDAA) as compared with healthy livers (CSAA). Upregulated genes in the CDAA group were associated with cancer-related functions, whereas macronutrient metabolic processes were enriched by downregulated genes. Changes of highest magnitude were detected in numerous upregulated genes that govern key oncogenic signalling pathways, including Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, and extracellular matrix degradation. We further detected perturbations in DNA methylating and demethylating enzymes, which was reflected in decreased global DNA methylation and increased global DNA hydroxymethylation. Four selected upregulated candidates, Mmp12, Jag1, Wnt4, and Smo, demonstrated promoter hypomethylation with the most profound decrease in Mmp12. MMP12 was also strongly overexpressed and hypomethylated in human HCC HepG2 cells as compared with primary hepatocytes, which coincided with binding of Ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1).

Most common causes of B12 deficiency revolve around malabsorption and pernicious anemia; however, nitrous oxide (N2O) can also indirectly cause B12 deficiency by inactivating its biologically active form. We report a case of a patient who took advantage of the unregulated N2O market and presented with signs and symptoms of SCD secondary to N2O abuse. Prior to symptom onset, the patient reported approximately 3,000g of N2O inhalation within five days prior to symptom onset in addition to daily use three weeks prior. Work up revealed laboratory and imaging abnormalities consistent with SCD, although B12 levels were normal intrinsic-factor-blocking (IFB) antibodies were present. Appropriate treatment was undertaken, and the patient was followed up at one week and one month with noticeable clinical improvements. Similarities of this patient to literature include the classic presenting symptoms of SCD and the gradual symptomatic improvement with B12 injections and N2O abstinence. This case is remarkable due to SCD occurrence after recreational N2O abuse, objective quantification of N2O intake over a specified time period to induce SCD, occurrence secondary to N2O inhalation, positive IFB antibodies, and symptomatic presentation with B12 values within normal limits.

Caspofungin was shown to be more effective than fluconazole in treating inpatients with IC/C. However, cost-effectiveness of caspofungin for treating IC/C in Ethiopia remains unknown. We aimed to assess the cost-utility of caspofungin compared to fluconazole-initiated therapies as primary treatment of IC/C in Ethiopia. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to compare the cost-utility of caspofungin versus fluconazole antifungal agents as first-line treatment for adult inpatients with IC/C from the Ethiopian health system perspective. Treatment outcome was categorized as either a clinical success or failure, with clinical failure being switched to a different antifungal medication. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) was used as a rescue agent for patients who had failed caspofungin treatment, while caspofungin or L-AmB were used for patients who had failed fluconazole treatment. Primary outcomes were expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs (US$2021), and the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). These QALYs and costs were discounted at 3% annually. Cost data was obtained from Addis Ababa hospitals while locally unavailable data were derived from the literature. Cost-effectiveness was assessed against the recommended threshold of 50% of Ethiopia's gross domestic product/capita (i.e.,US$476). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, treatment of IC/C with caspofungin as first-line treatment resulted in better health outcomes (12.86 QALYs) but higher costs (US$7,714) compared to fluconazole-initiated treatment followed by caspofungin (12.30 QALYs; US$3,217) or L-AmB (10.92 QALYs; US$2,781) as second-line treatment. Caspofungin as primary treatment for IC/C was not cost-effective when compared to fluconazole-initiated therapies. Fluconazole-initiated treatment followed by caspofungin was cost-effective for the treatment of IC/C compared to fluconazole with L-AmB as second-line treatment, at US$316/QALY gained. Our findings were sensitive to medication costs, drug effectiveness, infection recurrence, and infection-related mortality rates. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$476/QALY, treating IC/C patient with fluconazole-initiated treatment followed by caspofungin was more likely to be cost-effective in 67.2% of simulations. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the use of caspofungin as primary treatment for IC/C in Ethiopia was not cost-effective when compared with fluconazole-initiated treatment alternatives. The findings supported the use of fluconazole-initiated therapy with caspofungin as a second-line treatment for patients with IC/C in Ethiopia.", "pmid": "36309674"}

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the anticancer affects of bergamottin (muM) against colon cancer cells. Material and methods: Antiproliferative effects were evaluated by WST-1 cell viability assay. Apoptotic effects were studied by DAPI and Annexin V/PI staining. Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Transwell assay was used to study the effects on cell invasion. Protein expression was estimated by the western blot method. Results: The results showed that bergamottin suppresses the proliferation of all the human colon cancer cell lines. Nonetheless, the growth inhibitory effects of bergamottin on the HT-29 and RKO cells were more significant (IC50, 12.5 muM). The anticancer effects of bergamottin on the HT-29 and RKO cells were mainly due to apoptosis. Bergamottin could considerably increase the expression of Bax and reduce the expression Bcl-2. The cleavage of caspase-3, 8 and 9 was also enhanced upon bergamottin treatment of the colon cancer cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that bergamottin also induced G2/M cell cycle arrest of the HT-29 and RKO cells. Additionally, bergamottin could also suppress the invasion of HT-29 and RKO cells. The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is regarded as one of the essential pathways involved in the development and progression of cancers. Herein, it was observed that bergamottin could concentration dependently block this pathway in colon cancer cells. In vivo study revealed that bergamottin could also suppress the growth of tumours in xenografted mice models.

METHODS: Patients undergoing phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation (IOL) were randomised in two groups: group 1, twice daily (b.i.d.) dexamethasone 0.1%/netilmicin 0.3% (Netildex) ophthalmic gel; group 2, four times daily (q.i.d.) dexamethasone 0.1%/netilmicin 0.3% (Netildex) eye drops. Both treatments were administered for 14 days after surgery. Patients were evaluated before surgery, on the day of surgery and at 1, 7, 15 and 60 postoperative days. The primary efficacy endpoint was evaluation of cellularity and flare in the anterior chamber through slit-lamp biomicroscopy 7 days after surgery. Secondary endpoints included: presence of signs/symptoms of postoperative ocular inflammation and incidence of infection. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients were randomised and 168 were evaluable. Flare and cellularity were resolved at day 7 in 92.5% of patients and almost completely by day 15. In both intent to treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations, the efficacy analysis demonstrated that the gel formulation administered twice a day was non-inferior to the eye drops administered four times a day. For ITT analysis, the lower limit of the 97.5% confidence interval (- 0.0535) was greater than the non-inferiority limit of -0.10. For the PP analysis, the lower limit of the 97.5% confidence interval (- 0.0526) was greater than the non-inferiority limit of - 0.10. The patient's global tolerability and reported symptoms were similar between treatment groups. No microbial load and no safety events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of the gel reduced posology (twice a day) is not inferior to four times a day eye drops. Both treatments were well tolerated and efficacious. The new reduced posology hydrogel formulation may improve patient compliance and quality of life. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Eudract: 2016-0021138-63; ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT029738880.", "pmid": "36203046"}

We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice. Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir-treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation. In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. We have utilized the human monocyte cell line, THP-1 as a model to address this question. Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2), 100 nM progesterone or vehicle (0.01% ethanol). Cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total RNA was isolated. E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment. Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, responsible for the uptake of LDL. Additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression. Treatment with E2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level. E2 did, however, significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment.", "pmid": "17879945"}

Interleukin (IL)-10, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) are assumed to be closely related to the occurrence and development of human cancer. Some have been used as diagnostic markers in CRC. It remains unclear whether cytokines in combination with CEA could be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of CRC. Serum levels of IL-10, IL-17, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and TGF-beta in patients with CRC, ulcerative colitis, colonic polyps, stomach cancer, and healthy controls were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum level of CEA was detected using electrochemiluminescence. The value of the cytokines combined with CEA as a biomarker panel for the diagnosis of CRC was assessed. CEA, IL-10, IL-17A, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta levels were significantly increased in CRC. CEA displayed a higher specificity than the other cytokines. IL-17A, TNF-alpha, and TGF-beta displayed higher sensitivities than CEA, IL-10, and IFN-gamma in the diagnosis of CRC. The combination of serum CEA, IL-17A, and TNF-alpha achieved higher diagnostic efficacy for CRC (area under the curve = 0.935). The combination of CEA, IL-17, and TNF-alpha has better diagnostic efficacy than CEA alone in CRC. A panel containing IL-17A, TNF-alpha, and CEA could be a promising molecular biomarker panel to diagnostically differentiate CRC from ulcerative colitis, colon polyps, and stomach cancer.", "pmid": "36123861"}

LPL presenting as a hepatic mass lesion is extremely rare, with only one case reported in the English literature. A 70-year-old Japanese female presented to us with a right hypochondriac mass with tenderness. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 14 cm-sized bulky hepatic mass. Laboratory findings showed a normal white blood cell count of 4.1x109/L with 4% plasmacytoid lymphocytes; normocytic anemia, Hb 9.4 g/dL; high soluble IL-2 receptor level, 2,290 U/mL; and elevated IgG, 10,306 mg/dL. Furthermore, IgG-kappa monoclonal protein was detected. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT revealed abnormal uptake in the liver mass; left supraclavicular, parasternal, abdominal, and left inguinal lymph nodes; and bilateral lung bases. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no bone lesions. BM aspiration and liver biopsy showed predominant infiltration of small lymphocytes admixed with plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells. In the liver specimen, lymphoepithelial lesions were not observed. The small lymphocytes were positive for CD20, CD79a, and bcl-2, and negative for CD5, CD10, cyclin D1, and IRTA1; plasma cells in BM were positive for CD19, CD45, IgG, and kappa-chain, and negative for CD20, and CD56. MYD88 L265P mutation, reported in approximately 40% of non-IgM LPL cases, was not detected in the liver specimen and BM cells. The frequency is lower than that of typical IgM LPL. These findings led us to a diagnosis of LPL with IgG-kappa paraproteinemia. The patient underwent four courses of R-CHOP and two courses of Bendamustine-R.

However, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors of both receptors have thus far failed to provide clinical benefits for esophageal cancer patients. Studies have confirmed the complicated crosstalks that exist between the EGFR and IGF-1R pathways. The EGFR and IGF-1R signals act as mutual compensation pathways, thereby conveying resistance to EGFR or IGF-1R inhibitors when used alone. This study evaluated the antitumor efficacy of the EGFR/HER2 inhibitors, gefitinib and lapatinib, in combination with the IGF-1R inhibitor, linsitinib, on the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Gefitinib or lapatinib, in combination with linsitinib, synergistically inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ESCC cells, caused significant cell cycle arrest, and induced marked cell apoptosis. Their combination demonstrated stronger inhibition on the activation of EGFR, HER2, and IGF-1R as well as the downstream signaling molecules. In vivo, the addition of linsitinib to gefitinib or lapatinib also potentiated the inhibition effects on the growth of xenografts. Our results suggest the next clinical exploration of the combination of gefitinib or lapatinib with linsitinib in the treatment of ESCC patients.", "pmid": "36142299"}

In addition, some scholars found that EAF2 frameshift mutations are associated with intratumor heterogeneity in colorectal cancer (CRC) and inactivation of EAF2 in microsatellite instability-high CRC. However, the molecular mechanism by which EAF2 is involved in CRC invasion and metastasis remains unclear. AIM: To determine the clinical value of expression of EAF2 protein in CRC, and to study the effects of EAF2 on the invasion, migration, and angiogenesis of CRC cells in vitro. METHODS: In this study, we collected colorectal adenocarcinoma and corresponding adjacent tissues to investigate the clinical expression of EAF2 protein in patients with advanced CRC. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of EAF2 on the invasion, migration, and angiogenesis of CRC cells in vitro using plasmid transfection. RESULTS: EAF2 protein was lowly expressed in cancer tissues of patients with advanced CRC. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the survival rate of the high EAF2 level group was higher than that of the low EAF2 level group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that EAF2, as a tumor suppressor, may inhibit the invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of CRC cells by regulating the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/transforming growth factor-beta1 crosstalk pathway, and play a cancer suppressive and protective role in the occurrence and development of CRC. Our findings are of great significance to provide a new idea and theoretical basis for the targeted diagnosis and treatment of CRC.", "pmid": "36310706"}

These contaminants interfere with the thyroid function through the impairment of thyroid hormone synthesis, plasma transport, peripheral metabolism, transport into the target cells, and thyroid hormone action. It is well known that iodide uptake mediated by the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) is the first limiting step involved in thyroid hormones production. Therefore, it has been described that several thyroid disruptors interfere with the thyroid function through the regulation of NIS expression and/or activity. Perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate competitively inhibit the NIS-mediated iodide uptake. These contaminants are mainly found in food, water and in the smoke of cigarettes. Although the impact of the human exposure to these anions is highly controversial, some studies indicated their deleterious effects in the thyroid function, especially in individuals living in iodine deficient areas.

Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and verapamil treatment. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of pheochromocytoma are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In our case, use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and amisulpride and tiapride therapy. CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of amisulpride- and tiapride-induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with pheochromocytoma.

Their new findings show that the level of the GDNF signaling receptor Ret is overall markedly reduced relative to the non-PD controls, and most severely, up to 80%, in nigral neurons containing alpha-synuclein inclusions, accompanied by impaired signaling downstream of the Ret receptor. Notably, however, the vast majority of the remaining nigral neurons retained a low level of Ret expression, and hence a threshold level of signaling. Further observations made in two patients who had received AAV-NRTN gene therapy 8-10 years earlier suggest the intriguing possibility that NRTN is able to restore Ret expression and upregulate its own signaling pathway. This \"wind-up\" mechanism, which is likely to depend on an interaction with dopaminergic transcription factor Nurr1, has therapeutic potential and should encourage renewed efforts to turn GDNF/NRTN therapy into success, once the recurring problem of under-dosing is resolved.", "pmid": "33935108"}

Many factors can affect this community's composition, such as age, sex, diet, medications, and environmental triggers. The relationship between the human host and the gut microbiota is crucial for the organism's survival and development, whereas the disruption of this relationship can lead to various inflammatory diseases. Cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are used to treat muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. It is now clear that these compounds also benefit patients with neuroinflammation. CBD and THC are used in the treatment of inflammation. The gut is a significant source of nutrients, including vitamins B and K, which are gut microbiota products. While these vitamins play a crucial role in brain and bone development and function, the influence of gut microbiota on the gut-brain and gut-bone axes extends further and continues to receive increasing scientific scrutiny. The gut microbiota has been demonstrated to be vital for optimal brain functions and stress suppression. Additionally, several studies have revealed the role of gut microbiota in developing and maintaining skeletal integrity and bone mineral density. It can also influence the development and maintenance of bone matrix. The presence of the gut microbiota can influence the actions of specific T regulatory cells, which can lead to the development of bone formation and proliferation. In addition, its metabolites can prevent bone loss. The gut microbiota can help maintain the bone's equilibrium and prevent the development of metabolic diseases, such as osteoporosis. In this review, the dual functions gut microbiota plays in regulating the gut-bone axis and gut-brain axis and the impact of CBD on these roles are discussed.", "pmid": "36557285"}
{"abstract_id": "578", "title": "An Acid-Sensitive Bone Targeting Delivery System Carrying Acacetin Prevents Osteoporosis in Ovariectomized Mice.", "abstract": "One effective treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis is to inhibit osteoclasts and subsequent bone resorption. In our study, we demonstrated that acacetin, a flavone with potential therapeutic effects in infections, cancers, and several metabolic disorders, inhibited osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption in vitro. For improving the efficacy of acacetin in vivo, we developed an acid-sensitive bone-targeting delivery system composed of an acid-sensitive linker (N-epsilon-maleimidocaproic acid hydrazide, EMCH) for ensuring an effective release of acacetin at the site of action and a hydrophilic aspartic acid hexapeptide ((Asp)6, D6) as the effective bone targeting agent. Our results revealed that Acacetin-EMCH-D6 specifically bound to the bone surface once administrated in vivo, prolonged the retention time in bone and released acacetin at the osteoclastic bone resorption sites where the acidity is higher. We further demonstrated that, in ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis mice, treatment with Acacetin-EMCH-D6 inhibited osteoclast formation and increased trabecular bone mass. On the contrary, neither acacetin nor EMCH-D6 with the same dosage alone showed significant anti-osteoporosis effects in vivo. Mechanistically, targeted delivery of acacetin to the bone resorption sites by Acacetin-EMCH-D6 inhibited autophagy through activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in osteoclasts, while the activation of autophagy by rapamycin partially reversed the inhibitory effects of acacetin in vitro and in vivo. In summary, our study, for the first time, showed that the acid-sensitive bone-targeting delivery system carrying acacetin was effective for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Thus, targeted delivery of acacetin using Acacetin-EMCH-D6 to bone resorption sites is a promising therapy for osteoporosis.", "pmid": "36678499"}

VRK1 dependency was inversely correlated with expression of its paralog VRK2. VRK2 knockout sensitized cells to VRK1 loss, and conversely, VRK2 overexpression increased cell fitness in the setting of VRK1 loss. DNA methylation of the VRK2 promoter was associated with low VRK2 expression in human neuroblastomas and adult and pediatric gliomas.

METHODS: Untargeted metabolomic analysis was done on prediagnostic plasma samples from a case-cohort study of 1695 incident breast cancer cases and a 1983 women subcohort drawn from Cancer Prevention Study 3. The associations of 868 named metabolites (per one standard deviation increase) with breast cancer were determined using Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. RESULTS: A total of 11 metabolites were associated with breast cancer at false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 with the majority having inverse association [ranging from RR = 0.85 (95% CI 0.80-0.92) to RR = 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.94)] and one having a positive association [RR = 1.14 (95% CI 1.06-1.23)].

First, qRT-PCR showed that miR-202 was down-regulated in EC tissues, which was associated with poor prognosis in EC patients. Functionally, transwell assay indicated that miR-202 inhibited cell migration and invasion in EC cells. In addition, miR-202 also blocked epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through suppressing N-cadherin and Vimentin expressions and promoting E-cadherin expression. Moreover, the dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a direct target gene for miR-202 in EC cells. Furthermore, up-regulation of FGF2 attenuated the inhibitory effect of miR-202 on cell migration and invasion in EC.

The visual cycle regenerates visual pigments chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, and eliminates its toxic byproducts from the retina, supporting visual function and retinal neuron survival. Unfortunately, during the visual cycle, when 11-cis-retinal is being regenerated in the retina, toxic byproducts, such as all-trans-retinal and bis-retinoid is N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E), are produced, which are proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of the dry form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The primary biochemical defect in Stargardt disease (STGD1) is the accelerated synthesis of cytotoxic lipofuscin bisretinoids, such as A2E, in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) due to mutations in the ABCA4 gene. To prevent all-trans-retinal-and bisretinoid-mediated retinal degeneration, slowing down the retinoid flow by modulating the visual cycle with a small molecule has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy. The present study describes RPE65-61, a novel, non-retinoid compound, as an inhibitor of RPE65 (a key enzyme in the visual cycle), intended to modulate the excessive activity of the visual cycle to protect the retina from harm degenerative diseases. Our data demonstrated that (+-)-RPE65-61 selectively inhibited retinoid isomerase activity of RPE65, with an IC50 of 80 nM. Furthermore, (+-)-RPE65-61 inhibited RPE65 via an uncompetitive mechanism. Systemic administration of (+-)-RPE65-61 in mice resulted in slower chromophore regeneration after light bleach, confirming in vivo target engagement and visual cycle modulation. Concomitant protection of the mouse retina from high-intensity light damage was also observed. Furthermore, RPE65-61 down-regulated the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, decreased the inflammatory factor, and attenuated retinal apoptosis caused by light-induced retinal damage (LIRD), which led to the preservation of the retinal function.

Until recently, it was thought that TSHR initiated signal transduction pathways only at the cell-surface and that internalization was primarily involved in TSHR desensitization and downregulation. Studies primarily in mouse cells showed that TSHR internalization regulates gene transcription at an intracellular site also. However, this has not been shown for genes involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis in human thyrocytes. We used human thyrocytes in primary culture. In these cells, the dose-response to TSH for gene expression is biphasic with low doses upregulating gene expression and higher doses decreasing gene expression. We used two approaches to inhibit internalization. In the first, we used inhibitors of dynamins, dynasore and dyngo-4a. Pretreatment with dynasore or dyngo-4a markedly inhibited TSH upregulation of TG and TPO mRNAs, as well as TG secretion. In the second, we used knockdown of dynamin 2, which is the most abundant dynamin in human thyrocytes. We showed that dynamin 2 knockdown inhibited TSHR internalization and decreased the TSH-stimulated levels of TG and TPO mRNAs and proteins. Lastly, we showed that the level of the activatory transcription factor phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) in the cell nuclei was reduced by 68% when internalization was inhibited. We conclude that upregulation of genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis in human thyrocytes is, in part, dependent on internalization leading to nuclear localization of an activated transcription factor(s).", "pmid": "34896620"}

According to the classification in adult Asian populations, participants were categorized into four groups: lean NAFLD (BMI <23, n = 106), non-lean NAFLD (BMI >=23, n = 644), lean non-NAFLD (BMI <23, n = 216) and non-lean non-NAFLD (BMI >=23, n = 253).116 NAFLD-related candidate genes, which cover 179 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the KEGG enrichment analysis. Independent samples t-test was adopted for the group comparison. The associations between genetic variations with the specific phenotype in five genetic models were analyzed with the \"SNPassoc\" R package and rechecked with logistic regression analysis. Mediation models were conducted to explore whether the certain phenotype can mediate the association between SNPs and the risk of lean NAFLD. Results: Compared with lean non-NAFLD individuals, lean NAFLD patients had higher BMI, low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride, and lower HDL. The AMPK signaling pathway, which includes TBC1D1 and ADIPOQ genes, was the most significant (p < .001). The A allele frequency of rs2279028 in TBC1D1 (p = .006) and G allele frequency of rs17366568 in ADIPOQ (p = .038) were significantly lower in lean NAFLD. The association between rs2279028 and the risk of lean NAFLD was mediated by HDL (p = .014). No significant mediation effect was found between rs17366568 and the risk of lean NAFLD. Conclusion: This study, for the first time, indicated that rs2279028 of TBC1D1 may contribute to the progression of lean NAFLD through HDL. This finding provides more evidence for exploring the mechanism of lean NAFLD and suggests practical solutions for the treatment of lean NAFLD.", "pmid": "36712867"}

Angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) has been documented to have a cell-autonomous involvement in podocytes, and deletion of Angptl3 in podocytes reduced proteinuria in adriamycin-induced nephropathy. Here, we developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against ANGPTL3 to investigate its effects on podocyte injury in an ADR nephropathy mouse model and puromycin (PAN) induced podocyte damage in vitro. The mAb against the human ANGPTL3-FLD sequence (5E5F6) inhibited the binding of ANGPTL3-FLD to integrin beta3. Treatment with the 5E5F6 mAb in ADR nephropathy mice mitigated proteinuria and led to a significant decline in podocyte apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial fragmentation. In PAN-induced podocyte damage in vitro, the 5E5F6 mAb blocked the ANPGPLT3-mediated activation of integrin alphavbeta3 and Rac1, which regulated the mitochondrial homeostasis. Altogether, anti-ANGPLT3-FLD mAb attenuates proteinuria and podocyte lesions in ADR mice models, as well as PAN-induced podocyte damage, in part through regulating mitochondrial functions.

In this study we investigated a newborn patient with fetal bradycardia, 2:1 atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia soon after birth. METHODS: Mutational analysis and DNA sequencing were conducted in a newborn. The 2:1 atrioventricular block improved to 1:1 conduction only after intravenous lidocaine infusion or a high dose of mexiletine, which also controlled the ventricular tachycardia. RESULTS: A novel, spontaneous LQTS-3 mutation was identified in the transmembrane segment 6 of domain IV of the Na(v)1.5 cardiac sodium channel, with a G-->A substitution at codon 1763, which changed a valine (GTG) to a methionine (ATG). The proband was heterozygous but the mutation was absent in the parents and the sister. Expression of this mutant channel in tsA201 mammalian cells by site-directed mutagenesis revealed a persistent tetrodotoxin-sensitive but lidocaine-resistant current that was associated with a positive shift of the steady-state inactivation curve, steeper activation curve and faster recovery from inactivation. We also found a similar electrophysiological profile for the neighboring V1764M mutant. But, the other neighboring I1762A mutant had no persistent current and was still associated with a positive shift of inactivation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the Na(v)1.5/V1763M channel dysfunction and possible neighboring mutants contribute to a persistent inward current due to altered inactivation kinetics and clinically congenital LQTS with perinatal onset of arrhythmias that responded to lidocaine and mexiletine.", "pmid": "15485686"}

The green and novel protocol was successfully developed for the synthesis of covellite (CuS, Cu2+) and the covellite-villamaninite (CuS-CuS2) (copper in Cu2+, Cu1+) phases of copper sulfide, employing EDTA both as the chelating and capping agent via a simple precipitation method at room temperature using water as the solvent. A blue shift in the absorption spectra and band gap in the range of 2.02-2.07 eV prompted the investigation of the as-synthesized CS nanoparticles as the photocatalyst under visible light irradiation. In the absence of any oxidizing or reducing agent, covellite CuS nanoparticles showed the highest photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) and the reduction of carcinogenic and mutagenic Cr(vi) to non-toxic Cr(iii). Interestingly, the mixed phase of CS (CuS-CuS2), where Cu is present in both +1 and +2 oxidation states, was found to be the most efficient catalyst compared to CuS toward the visible light-mediated selective oxidation of various benzyl alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes. However, in the synthesis of substituted NH-1,2,3-triazoles, single-phase CS nanoparticles (i.e., CuS) provided the best catalytic result.

However, the clinical efficacy of the local administration of daptomycin for the management of osteoarticular infections remains unclear. This in vitro study compared the efficacy of daptomycin and vancomycin against MRSA biofilms. The elution kinetics of daptomycin and vancomycin, combined with gentamicin and loaded with either beta-tricalcium phosphate/calcium sulfate or calcium sulfate, in the presence of MRSA infection, was assessed. Their efficacy in preventing biofilm formation and killing pre-formed biofilms was assessed using colony-forming unit count and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In addition, the efficacy of daptomycin, vancomycin, and gentamicin in prophylaxis and eradication of MRSA biofilms was also evaluated. Daptomycin + gentamicin and vancomycin + gentamicin displayed similar antimicrobial potency against MRSA, by either beta-tricalcium phosphate/calcium sulfate or calcium sulfate. In the prevention assays, both daptomycin + gentamicin and vancomycin + gentamicin showed similar efficacy in preventing bacterial colony formation, with approximately 6 logs lower colony-forming units than those in the control group at both 1 and 3  days. The killing effect on pre-formed biofilms showed significant decreases of approximately 4 logs at 1 and 3  days following treatment with daptomycin + gentamicin and vancomycin + gentamicin. In addition, the confocal laser scanning microscopy results support the colony-forming unit data. Moreover, single use of vancomycin and gentamicin showed similar efficacies in preventing and killing MRSA biofilms, both of which were better than that of gentamicin. Our study demonstrated that vancomycin + gentamicin and daptomycin + gentamicin loaded with beta-tricalcium phosphate/calcium sulfate or calcium sulfate showed similar prophylactic and killing effects on MRSA biofilms, implying a potential indication of local administration daptomycin for the treatment of MRSA-associated osteoarticular infections, especially if vancomycin administration presents limitations.", "pmid": "36406460"}

Although broadly successful, the use of albendazole and mebendazole achieved variable progress, with deficiencies against Trichuris trichiura and a predictable low efficacy against Strongyloides stercoralis. Novel drug combinations offer a potential solution, providing they can be delivered safely and maintain efficacy against all STH species. Here we present the protocol of a clinical trial to evaluate a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet containing albendazole and ivermectin that will be compared against albendazole against STH . Methods: An adaptive phase II/III randomized controlled trial will be undertaken in STH endemic sites in Ethiopia, Kenya and Mozambique to evaluate an oral FDC of 400 mg albendazole and either 9- or 18 mg ivermectin. FDC will be administered as a single dose or single doses over three-consecutive days and assessed against a single dose of 400 mg albendazole. In the phase II trial, 126 T. trichiura-infected children weighting 15 to 45 kg will be treated in a dose-escalation manner to determine safety objectives. In the phase III trial, 1097 participants aged 5 to 18 years old infected with T. trichiura, hookworm and S. stercoralis will be recruited to determine safety and efficacy. The trial will be open-label with blinded outcome assessors. Cure rate measured 21-days after-treatment in duplicate Kato-Katz is the primary efficacy outcome. Secondary objectives include efficacy evaluation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as an outcome measurement, description of pharmacokinetic parameters, palatability and acceptability evaluations, and monitoring of anthelmintic resistance.

In this study, a methodology to overcome this limitation is demonstrated, as well as the effect of PNA on cell viability. We show that extruding a mixture of natural phospholipids and short (6-22 bases), cytosine-rich PNA through a 100 nm pore size membrane under mild acidic conditions resulted in the formation of small (60-90 nm in diameter) multilamellar vesicles (SMVs) comprising several (3-5) concentric lipid membranes. The PNA molecules, being positively charged under acidic conditions (due to protonation of cytosine bases in the sequence), bind electrostatically to negatively charged phospholipid membranes. The large membrane surface area allowed the encapsulation of thousands of PNA molecules in the vesicle. SMVs were conjugated with the designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin_9-29), which interacts with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), overexpressed in human breast cancer. The conjugate was shown to enter HER2-overexpressing cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. PNA molecules, released from lysosomes, aggregate in the cytoplasm into micron-sized particles, which interfere with normal cell functioning, causing cell death. The ability of DARPin-functionalized SMVs to specifically deliver large quantities of PNA to cancer cells opens a new promising avenue for cancer therapy.", "pmid": "36230729"}
{"abstract_id": "599", "title": "Endogenous TRAIL-R4 critically impacts apoptotic and non-apoptotic TRAIL-induced signaling in cancer cells.", "abstract": "Binding of TRAIL to its death domain-containing receptors TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 can induce cell death and/or pro-inflammatory signaling. The importance of TRAIL and TRAIL-R1/R2 in tumor immune surveillance and cancer biology has meanwhile been well documented. In addition, TRAIL has been shown to preferentially kill tumor cells, raising hope for the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies. Apart from death-inducing receptors, TRAIL also binds to TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4. Whereas TRAIL-R3 is lacking an intracellular domain entirely, TRAIL-R4 contains a truncated death domain but still a signaling-competent intracellular part. It is assumed that these receptors have anti-apoptotic, yet still not well understood regulatory functions. To analyze the significance of the endogenous levels of TRAIL-R4 for TRAIL-induced signaling in cancer cells, we stably knocked down this receptor in Colo357 and MDA-MB-231 cells and analyzed the activation of apoptotic and non-apoptotic pathways in response to treatment with TRAIL. We found that TRAIL-R4 affects a plethora of signaling pathways, partly in an opposite way. While knockdown of TRAIL-R4 in Colo357 strongly increased apoptosis and reduced clonogenic survival, it inhibited cell death and improved clonogenic survival of MDA-MB-231 cells after TRAIL treatment. Furthermore, TRAIL-R4 turned out to be an important regulator of the expression of a variety of anti-apoptotic proteins in MDA-MB-231 cells since TRAIL-R4-KD reduced the cellular levels of FLIPs, XIAP and cIAP2 but upregulated the levels of Bcl-xL. By inhibiting Bcl-xL with Navitoclax, we could finally show that this protein mainly accounts for the acquired resistance of MDA-MB-231 TRAIL-R4-KD cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Analyses of non-apoptotic signaling pathways revealed that in both cell lines TRAIL-R4-KD resulted in a constitutively increased activity of AKT and ERK, while it reduced AKT activity after TRAIL treatment. Furthermore, TRAIL-R4-KD potentiated TRAIL-induced activation of ERK and p38 in Colo357, and NF-kappaB in MDA-MB-231 cells. Importantly, in both cell lines the activity of AKT, ERK, p38 and NF-kappaB after TRAIL treatment was higher in TRAIL-R4-KD cells than in respective control cells. Thus, our data provide evidence for the important regulatory functions of endogenous TRAIL-R4 in cancer cells and improve our understanding of the very complex human TRAIL/TRAIL-R system.", "pmid": "36158196"}

We thus attempted to confirm neuroprotective effects of NSP on astrocytes in the ischemic state and then explored the relative mechanisms. Astrocytes from neonatal rats were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R). To confirm the neuroprotective effects of NSP, we measured the cell survival rate, relative lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release; we also performed morphological methods, namely Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V assay. To explore the potential mechanisms of NSP, the release of nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-alpha related to NSP administration were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The proteins related to the NF-kappaB, ERK1/2, and PI3K/Akt pathways were investigated by Western blotting. To verify the cause-and-effect relationship between neuroprotection and the NF-kappaB pathway, a NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor sc3060 was employed to observe the effects of NSP-induced neuroprotection. We found that NSP significantly increased the cell survival rate and reduced LDH release in OGD/R-treated astrocytes. It also reduced NO/TNF-alpha release. Western blotting showed that the protein levels of p-IKKBalpha/beta and P65 were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment and such effects were significantly inhibited by NSP administration. The NSP-induced inhibition could be significantly reversed by administration of the NF-kappaB pathway inhibitor sc3060, whereas, expressions of p-ERK1, p-ERK2, and p-AKT were upregulated by the OGD/R treatment; however, their levels were unchanged by NSP administration. Our results thus verified the neuroprotective effects of NSP in ischemic astrocytes. The potential mechanisms include inhibition of the release of NO/TNF-alpha and repression of the NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Our data also indicated that NSP has little influence on the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways.", "pmid": "25874935"}

The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane register CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase were searched and studies published between January 2015 and May 2021 were included. The certainty of evidence was assessed according to the GRADE methodology. The main outcome measures were development of AMD, progression of AMD, and side effects. We included 7 systematic reviews, 7 RCTs, and 13 NRS. A high consumption of specific nutrients, i.e. beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, copper, folate, magnesium, vitamin A, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin C, docosahexaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid, was associated with a lower risk of progression of early to late AMD (high certainty of evidence). Use of antioxidant supplements and adherence to a Mediterranean diet, characterized by a high consumption of vegetables, whole grains, and nuts and a low consumption of red meat, were associated with a decreased risk of progression of early to late AMD (moderate certainty of evidence). A high consumption of alcohol was associated with a higher risk of developing AMD (moderate certainty of evidence). Supplementary vitamin C, vitamin E, or beta-carotene were not associated with the development of AMD, and supplementary omega-3 fatty acids were not associated with progression to late AMD (high certainty of evidence).

A more comprehensive understanding of skin development mechanisms will drive identification of new treatment targets and modalities. Here we report the Zebrafish Integument Project (ZIP), an expression-driven platform for identifying new skin genes and phenotypes in the vertebrate model Danio rerio (zebrafish). In vivo selection for skin-specific expression of gene-break transposon (GBT) mutant lines identified eleven new, revertible GBT alleles of genes involved in skin development. Eight genes--fras1, grip1, hmcn1, msxc, col4a4, ahnak, capn12, and nrg2a--had been described in an integumentary context to varying degrees, while arhgef25b, fkbp10b, and megf6a emerged as novel skin genes. Embryos homozygous for a GBT insertion within neuregulin 2a (nrg2a) revealed a novel requirement for a Neuregulin 2a (Nrg2a)-ErbB2/3-AKT signaling pathway governing the apicobasal organization of a subset of epidermal cells during median fin fold (MFF) morphogenesis. In nrg2a mutant larvae, the basal keratinocytes within the apical MFF, known as ridge cells, displayed reduced pAKT levels as well as reduced apical domains and exaggerated basolateral domains. Those defects compromised proper ridge cell elongation into a flattened epithelial morphology, resulting in thickened MFF edges. Pharmacological inhibition verified that Nrg2a signals through the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase network. Moreover, knockdown of the epithelial polarity regulator and tumor suppressor lgl2 ameliorated the nrg2a mutant phenotype. Identifying Lgl2 as an antagonist of Nrg2a-ErbB signaling revealed a significantly earlier role for Lgl2 during epidermal morphogenesis than has been described to date. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that successive, coordinated ridge cell shape changes drive apical MFF development, making MFF ridge cells a valuable model for investigating how the coordinated regulation of cell polarity and cell shape changes serves as a crucial mechanism of epithelial morphogenesis.", "pmid": "26110643"}

Our results showed that the increased content of malate in rice leaves caused by reducing N level was related to the increased synthesis of malate (the activity of leaf PEPC increased)and the decreased degradation of malate (the activity of leaf NADP-ME decreased), while the increased contents of citrate and isocitrate in rice leaves caused by reducing N level might not be caused by the increased biosynthesis, but due to the decrease in degradation of citrate and isocitrate (the activities of leaf CS, ACO, and NADP-IDH decreased). The increased content of malate in rice roots caused by reducing N level might be related to the increased biosynthesis and the decreased degradation of root malate (the activities of root NAD-MDH and PEPC increased, while the activity of NADP-ME decreased). Compared to the control (5 mM NH4NO3), the increased content of citrate in rice roots caused by reducing N level might be related to the increased biosynthesis rather than the decreased degradation of citrate, due to the higher activities of CS and ACO in rice roots under 0 mM N and 1mM N treatment when compared to that of the control ones. At the same time, the increased content of isocitrate in roots was related to the increased isomerization of isocitrate (the activity of root ACO increased) and the decreased degradation of isocitrate (the activity of root NADP-IDH decreased). With the reducing N level, the activities of N metabolism-related enzymes, such as nitrate reductase (NR), glutamine synthetase (GS), and glutamate synthase (GOGAT), decreased in rice leaves and roots, resulting in the decreased contents of total free amino acids (TFAAs) and soluble proteins in rice seedlings, and finally led to the growth inhibition. Our results showed that the dynamics of organic acids metabolism caused by reducing N level were different in rice leaves and roots. In conclusion, there was a close correlation between organic acids metabolism and N metabolism in rice leaves and roots under N-limited conditions; furthermore, such a correlation was more obvious in rice leaves than that of roots.", "pmid": "36235442"}

However, it remains to be uncovered underlying its cytotoxicity toward germ cells. In this study we found that CPT, a cell cycle-specific anticancer agent, reduced fecundity and exhibited significant cytotoxicity toward GSCs and two-cell cysts. We showed that CPT induced GSC loss and retarded two-cell cysts differentiation in a niche- or apoptosis-independent manner. Instead, CPT induced ectopic expression of a differentiation factor, bag of marbles (Bam), and regulated the expression of cyclin A, which contributed to GSC loss. In addition, CPT compromised two-cell cysts differentiation by decreasing the expression of Bam and inducing cell arrest at G1/S phase via cyclin A, eventually resulting in two-cell accumulation.

Only rs7599662 showed a significant negative association with susceptibility to COVID-19. The mutant T allele was presented at a significantly lower frequency in patients compared to HC. Analysis of recessive, dominant and codominant models demonstrated that rs7599662 TT genotype frequency was significantly lower in patients than in HC. In terms of haplotypes (in order: rs7599662, rs28992497 and rs28992498), frequency of CTC haplotype was significantly increased in patients compared to HC, while TTC haplotype showed significantly lower frequency in patients. The three SNPs influenced serum IL-38 levels and homozygous genotypes of mutant alleles were associated with elevated levels. In conclusion, this study indicated that IL38 gene in terms of promoter variants and haplotypes may have important implications for COVID-19 risk.", "pmid": "36375233"}

Currently, the only drugs of choice for radical cure are the 8-aminoquinolines (primaquine and tafenoquine), which are capable of killing hypnozoites and thus preventing P. vivax relapse. However, the therapeutic use of primaquine and tafenoquine is restricted because these drugs can cause hemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. This study aimed to assess and understand the hemolytic risk of using 8-aminoquinolines for radical treatment in a malaria endemic area of Thailand. Methods: The prevalence of G6PD deficiency was determined using a quantitative test in 1,125 individuals. Multiplexed high-resolution meltinging (HRM) assays were developed and applied to detect 12 G6PD mutations. Furthermore, biochemical and structural characterization of G6PD variants was carried out to understand the molecular basis of enzyme deficiency. Results: The prevalence of G6PD deficiency was 6.76% (76/1,125), as assessed by a phenotypic test. Multiplexed HRM assays revealed G6PD Mahidol in 15.04% (77/512) of males and 28.38% (174/613) of females, as well as G6PD Aures in one female. G6PD activity above the 30% cut-off was detected in those carrying G6PD Mahidol, even in hemizygous male individuals. Two variants, G6PD Murcia Oristano and G6PD Songklanagarind + Viangchan, were identified for the first time in Thailand. Biochemical characterization revealed that structural instability is the primary cause of enzyme deficiency in G6PD Aures, G6PD Murcia Oristano, G6PD Songklanagarind + Viangchan, and G6PD Chinese 4 + Viangchan, with double G6PD mutations causing more severe enzyme deficiency. Conclusion: In western Thailand, up to 22% of people may be ineligible for radical cure. Routine qualitative tests may be insufficient for G6PD testing, so quantitative tests should be implemented. G6PD genotyping should also be used to confirm G6PD status, especially in female individuals suspected of having G6PD deficiency. People with double G6PD mutations are more likely to have hemolysis than are those with single G6PD mutations because the double mutations significantly reduce the catalytic activity as well as the structural stability of the protein.", "pmid": "36339627"}

We report that MDMX overexpression increases preleukemic stem cell (pre-LSC) number and competitive advantage. Utilizing five newly generated murine models, we found that MDMX overexpression triggers progression of multiple chronic/asymptomatic preleukemic conditions to overt AML. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies revealed that MDMX overexpression exerts this function, unexpectedly, through activation of Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling in pre-LSCs. Mechanistically, MDMX binds CK1alpha and leads to accumulation of beta-Catenin in a p53-independent manner. Wnt/beta-Catenin inhibitors reverse MDMX-induced pre-LSC properties, and synergize with MDMX-p53 inhibitors. Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling correlates with MDMX expression in patients with preleukemic myelodysplastic syndromes and is associated with increased risk of progression to AML. Our work identifies MDMX overexpression as a pervasive preleukemic-to-AML transition mechanism in different genetically driven disease subtypes, and reveals Wnt/beta-Catenin as a non-canonical MDMX-driven pathway with therapeutic potential for progression prevention and cancer interception.", "pmid": "33667384"}

We enrolled five patients with non-hypertrophic nonunion. NHNCs isolated from nonunion tissue sampled during surgery were cultured, passaged, counted every 14 days, and analyzed. NHNCs were homogenous fibroblastic adherent cells and long-lived through at least 10 passages, with a slight decline. The cells were consistently positive for mesenchymal stem cell-related markers CD73 and CD105, and negative for the hematopoietic markers CD14 and CD45. NHNCs could differentiate into osteoblast lineage cells; however, they did not have strong calcification or sufficient chondrogenic differentiation capability. E-BMP-2 did not affect the proliferative capability of the cells but improved their osteogenic differentiation capability by increasing alkaline phosphatase activity and upregulating the gene expression of osterix, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin. E-BMP-2 enhanced their chondrogenic differentiation capability by upregulating the gene expression of aggrecan and collagen type II. We showed, for the first time, that NHNCs have the capacity to differentiate into osteoblast-lineage cells, although the chondrogenic differentiation potential was poor. Local application of E-BMP-2 with preservation of nonunion tissue is a potential treatment option for non-hypertrophic nonunion.", "pmid": "36354689"}

However, much less is known about the role of PPARa in human liver. METHODS: Here we set out to study the function of PPARa in human liver via analysis of whole genome gene regulation in human liver slices treated with the PPARa agonist Wy14643. RESULTS: Quantitative PCR indicated that PPARa is well expressed in human liver and human liver slices and that the classical PPARa targets PLIN2, VLDLR, ANGPTL4, CPT1A and PDK4 are robustly induced by PPARa activation. Transcriptomics analysis indicated that 617 genes were upregulated and 665 genes were downregulated by PPARa activation (q value < 0.05). Many genes induced by PPARa activation were involved in lipid metabolism (ACSL5, AGPAT9, FADS1, SLC27A4), xenobiotic metabolism (POR, ABCC2, CYP3A5) or the unfolded protein response, whereas most of the downregulated genes were involved in immune-related pathways. Among the most highly repressed genes upon PPARa activation were several chemokines (e.g. CXCL9-11, CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL6), interferon g-induced genes (e.g. IFITM1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) and numerous other immune-related genes (e.g. TLR3, NOS2, and LCN2). Comparative analysis of gene regulation by Wy14643 between human liver slices and primary human hepatocytes showed that down-regulation of gene expression by PPARa is much better captured by liver slices as compared to primary hepatocytes. In particular, PPARa activation markedly suppressed immunity/inflammation-related genes in human liver slices but not in primary hepatocytes. Finally, several putative new target genes of PPARa were identified that were commonly induced by PPARa activation in the two human liver model systems, including TSKU, RHOF, CA12 and VSIG10L. CONCLUSION: Our paper demonstrates the suitability and superiority of human liver slices over primary hepatocytes for studying the functional role of PPARa in human liver. Our data underscore the major role of PPARa in regulation of hepatic lipid and xenobiotic metabolism in human liver and reveal a marked immuno-suppressive/anti-inflammatory effect of PPARa in human liver slices that may be therapeutically relevant for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.", "pmid": "26449539"}

METHODS: In the TKI-naive cohort of J-ALTA, the primary end point was independent review committee (IRC)-assessed 12-month progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), intracranial response, overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: The data were cut approximately 12 months after last patient enrollment. Thirty-two patients with ALK TKI-naive ALK-positive NSCLC were enrolled (median age [range], 60.5 [29-85] years; median duration of follow-up, 14.2 [3.2-19.3] months; median treatment duration, 13.8 [0.4-19.3] months). IRC-assessed 12-month PFS was 93.0% (90% confidence interval (CI) 79.2-97.8%); ORR, 96.9% (95% CI 83.8-99.9%), 12-month OS, 96.9% (95% CI 79.8-99.6%), and median OS was not reached. Of five patients with measurable baseline CNS metastases, two had partial intracranial response. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were increased blood creatine phosphokinase (81%), hypertension (59%), and diarrhea (47%). Grade >= 3 adverse events occurred in 91% of patients; pneumonitis was reported in 3 (9%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the J-ALTA TKI-naive cohort, brigatinib demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy consistent with the international phase 3 study. The safety profile in Japanese patients was consistent with previous studies. Brigatinib is an important first-line option for Japanese patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.

Nodal/Activin/TGF-beta and BMP ligands are both present in the intra- and extracellular milieu during early development, and cross-talk between these two branches of developmental signaling is currently the subject of intense research focus. Here, we show that the Nodal induced lncRNA-Smad7 regulates cell fate determination via repression of BMP signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Depletion of lncRNA-Smad7 dramatically impairs cardiomyocyte differentiation in mESCs. Moreover, lncRNA-Smad7 represses Bmp2 expression through binding with the Bmp2 promoter region via (CA)12-repeats that forms an R-loop. Importantly, Bmp2 knockdown rescues defects in cardiomyocyte differentiation induced by lncRNA-Smad7 knockdown. Hence, lncRNA-Smad7 antagonizes BMP signaling in mESCs, and similarly regulates cell fate determination between osteocyte and myocyte formation in C2C12 mouse myoblasts. Moreover, lncRNA-Smad7 associates with hnRNPK in mESCs and hnRNPK binds at the Bmp2 promoter, potentially contributing to Bmp2 expression repression. The antagonistic effects between Nodal/TGF-beta and BMP signaling via lncRNA-Smad7 described in this work provides a framework for understanding cell fate determination in early development.", "pmid": "36134711"}
{"abstract_id": "615", "title": "Sedation and analgesia from prolonged pain and stress during mechanical ventilation in preterm infants: is dexmedetomidine an alternative to current practice?", "abstract": "Mechanical ventilation is an uncomfortable and potentially painful intervention. Opioids, such as morphine and fentanyl, are used for analgesia and sedation but there is uncertainty whether they reduce pain in mechanically ventilated infants. Moreover, there may be short-term and long-term adverse consequences such as respiratory depression leading to prolonged mechanical ventilation and detrimental long-term neurodevelopmental effects. Despite this, opioids are widely used, possibly due to a lack of alternatives.Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha-2-adrenergic agonist with analgesic and sedative effects, currently approved for adults, has come into use in newborn infants. It provides analgesia and simulates natural sleep with maintenance of spontaneous breathing and upper airway tone. Although data on pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics in preterm infants are scant, observational studies report that using dexmedetomidine in conjunction with opioids/benzodiazepines or on its own can reduce the cumulative exposure to opioids/benzodiazepines. As it does not cause respiratory depression, dexmedetomidine could enable quicker weaning and extubation. Dexmedetomidine has also been suggested as an adjunct to therapeutic hypothermia in hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and others have used it during painful procedures and surgery. Dexmedetomidine infusion can cause bradycardia and hypotension although most report clinically insignificant effects.The increasing number of publications of observational studies and clinical use demonstrates that dexmedetomidine is being used in newborn infants but data on safety and efficacy are scant and not of high quality. Importantly, there are no data on long-term neurodevelopmental impact on preterm or term-born infants. The acceptance of dexmedetomidine in routine clinical practice must be preceded by clinical evidence. We need adequately powered and well-designed randomised controlled trials investigating whether dexmedetomidine alone or with opioids/benzodiazepines in infants on mechanical ventilation reduces the need for opioids/benzodiazepine and improves neurodevelopment at 24 months and later as compared with the use of opioids/benzodiazepines alone.", "pmid": "36053596"}

Findings are confounded by major extrapulmonary toxicities, which preclude the ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding the role of PAH per se in EP remodeling. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the EP substrate and arrhythmic vulnerability of a new model of PAH that avoids extracardiopulmonary toxicities. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats underwent left pneumonectomy (Pn) followed by injection of the vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor Sugen-5416 (Su/Pn). Five weeks later, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed in vivo, optical action potential (AP) mapping ex vivo, and molecular analyses in vitro. RESULTS: Su/Pn rats exhibited right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and were highly prone to pacing-induced ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF). Underlying this susceptibility was disproportionate RV-sided prolongation of AP duration, which promoted formation of right-sided AP alternans at physiological rates. While propagation was impaired at all rates in Su/Pn rats, the extent of conduction slowing was most severe immediately before the emergence of interventricular lines of block and onset of VT/VF. Measurement of the cardiac wavelength revealed a decrease in Su/Pn relative to control. Nav1.5 and total connexin 43 expression was not altered, while connexin 43 phosphorylation was decreased in PAH. Col1a1 and Col3a1 transcripts were upregulated coinciding with myocardial fibrosis. Once generated, VT/VF was sustained by multiple reentrant circuits with a lower frequency of RV activation due to wavebreak formation. CONCLUSION: In this pure model of PAH, we document RV-predominant remodeling that promotes multiwavelet reentry underlying VT. The Su/Pn model represents a severe form of PAH that allows the study of EP properties without the confounding influence of extrapulmonary toxicity.", "pmid": "34563688"}

However, despite their disease-modifying potential, KIT D816V-targeting drugs, including midostaurin and avapritinib, may not produce long-term remissions in all patients. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK6 are promising targets in oncology. We found that shRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK4 and CDK6 results in growth arrest in the KIT D816V+ MC line HMC-1.2. The CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib suppressed the proliferation in primary neoplastic MC as well as in all HMC-1 and ROSA cell subclones that were examined. Abemaciclib was also found to block growth in the drug-resistant MC line MCPV-1, whereas no effects were seen with palbociclib and ribociclib. Anti-proliferative drug effects on MC were accompanied by cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors were found to synergize with the KIT-targeting drugs midostaurin, avapritinib, and nintedanib in inducing growth inhibition and apoptosis in neoplastic MCs.

Tumour induced beige/brown adipose tissue differentiation contributes to the hypermetabolic state of the breast cancer. However, the mediators and mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: Survival probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method based on immunohistochemistry results. Biochemical studies were performed to characterize the novel interrelation between breast cancer cells and adipocytes. RESULTS: We show that tumour-surrounding adipocytes exhibit an altered phenotype in terms of upregulated beige/brown characteristics and increased catabolism associated with an activated state characterized by the release of metabolites, including free fatty acids, pyruvate, lactate and ketone bodies. Likewise, tumour cells cocultivated with mature adipocytes exhibit metabolic adaptation and an aggressive phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that tumour cells induce beige/brown differentiation and remodel metabolism in resident adipocytes by exosomes from the co-culture system that carry high levels of miRNA-144 and miRNA-126. miRNA-144 promotes beige/brown adipocyte characteristics by downregulating the MAP3K8/ERK1/2/PPARgamma axis, and exosomal miRNA-126 remodels metabolism by disrupting IRS/Glut-4 signalling, activating the AMPK/autophagy pathway and stabilizing HIF1alpha expression in imminent adipocytes. In vivo inhibition of miRNA-144 or miRNA-126 decreases adipocyte-induced tumour growth.

Posttranscriptional regulation is a major gateway for glial activation as many mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory mediators contain adenine- and uridine-rich elements (ARE) in the 3' untranslated region which govern their expression. We have previously shown that HuR, an RNA regulator that binds to AREs, plays a major positive role in regulating inflammatory cytokine production in glia. HuR is predominantly nuclear in localization but translocates to the cytoplasm to exert a positive regulatory effect on RNA stability and translational efficiency. Homodimerization of HuR is necessary for translocation and we have developed a small molecule inhibitor, SRI-42127, that blocks this process. Here we show that SRI-42127 suppressed HuR translocation in LPS-activated glia in vitro and in vivo and significantly attenuated the production of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, iNOS, CXCL1, and CCL2. Cytokines typically associated with anti-inflammatory effects including TGF-beta1, IL-10, YM1, and Arg1 were either unaffected or minimally affected. SRI-42127 suppressed microglial activation in vivo and attenuated the recruitment/chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes. RNA kinetic studies and luciferase studies indicated that SRI-42127 has inhibitory effects both on mRNA stability and gene promoter activation.

However, treatment choices and targets for finding a solution to COVID-19's threat are becoming limited. A viable approach to combating the threat of COVID-19 is by unraveling newer pharmacological and therapeutic targets pertinent in the viral survival and adaptive mechanisms within the host biological milieu which in turn provides the opportunity to discover promising inhibitors against COVID-19. Therefore, using high-throughput virtual screening, manually curated compounds library from some medicinal plants were screened against four main drivers of SARS-CoV-2 (spike glycoprotein, PLpro, 3CLpro, and RdRp). In addition, molecular docking, Prime MM/GBSA (molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area) analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and drug-likeness screening were performed to identify potential phytodrugs candidates for COVID-19 treatment. In support of these approaches, we used a series of computational modeling approaches to develop therapeutic agents against COVID-19. Out of the screened compounds against the selected SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic targets, only compounds with no violations of Lipinski's rule of five and high binding affinity were considered as potential anti-COVID-19 drugs. However, lonchocarpol A, diplacol, and broussonol E (lead compounds) were recorded as the best compounds that satisfied this requirement, and they demonstrated their highest binding affinity against 3CLpro. Therefore, the 3CLpro target and the three lead compounds were selected for further analysis. Through protein-ligand mapping and interaction profiling, the three lead compounds formed essential interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with amino acid residues at the binding pocket of 3CLpro. The key amino acid residues at the 3CLpro active site participating in the hydrophobic and polar inter/intra molecular interaction were TYR54, PRO52, CYS44, MET49, MET165, CYS145, HIS41, THR26, THR25, GLN189, and THR190. The compounds demonstrated stable protein-ligand complexes in the active site of the target (3CLpro) over a 100 ns simulation period with stable protein-ligand trajectories. Drug-likeness screening shows that the compounds are druggable molecules, and the toxicity descriptors established that the compounds demonstrated a good biosafety profile.

RESULTS: COVID-19 patients displayed  48-, 74- and 125-fold increased urinary I-FABP levels at admission (n=283; P<0.001), day 7 (n=142; P<0.01) and day 14 (n=75; P<0.01) of hospitalisation. Critically ill patients and nonsurvivors showed higher I-FABP concentrations compared with patients with less severe illness. At admission, infected patients demonstrated enhanced production of plasma interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-6. The receiver operating characteristic curve suggested I-FABP as a biomarker for COVID-19 disease severity at admission (P<0.0001; Youden index=6.89; area under the curve=0.699). Patients with I-FABP >=6.89 showed higher IL-6 and C-reactive protein levels (P<0.001) at admission and had a prolonged length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed damage to enterocytes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is associated with illness severity, poor prognosis and exacerbated inflammatory response.", "pmid": "34597762"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Skin biopsy samples of 31 patients with a PCLBCL classified as either primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL; n = 19) or PCLBCL, leg type (n = 12), according to the WHO-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) classification, were investigated using array-based comparative genomic hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and examination of promoter hypermethylation. RESULTS: The most recurrent alterations in PCFCL were high-level DNA amplifications at 2p16.1 (63%) and deletion of chromosome 14q32.33 (68%). FISH analysis confirmed c-REL amplification in patients with gains at 2p16.1. In PCLBCL, leg type, most prominent aberrations were a high-level DNA amplification of 18q21.31-q21.33 (67%), including the BCL-2 and MALT1 genes as confirmed by FISH, and deletions of a small region within 9p21.3 containing the CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and NSG-x genes. Homozygous deletion of 9p21.3 was detected in five of 12 patients with PCLBCL, leg type, but in zero of 19 patients with PCFCL. Complete methylation of the promoter region of the CDKN2A gene was demonstrated in one PCLBCL, leg type, patient with hemizygous deletion, in one patient without deletion, but in zero of 19 patients with PCFCL. Seven of seven PCLBCL, leg type, patients with deletion of 9p21.3 and/or complete methylation of CDKN2A died as a result of their lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate prominent differences in chromosomal alterations between PCFCL and PCLBCL, leg type, that support their classification as separate entities within the WHO-EORTC scheme. Inactivation of CDKN2A by either deletion or methylation of its promoter could be an important prognostic parameter for the group of PCLBCL, leg type.", "pmid": "16330669"}

Testicular damage was induced in rats by injecting DOX (12.5 mg/kg, i.p., single dose) into rats. alpha-Bisabolol (25 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to the rats along with DOX pre- and co-treatment daily for a period of 5 days. DOX-injected rats showed a decrease in absolute testicular weight and relative testicular weight ratio along with concomitant changes in the levels/expression levels of oxidative stress markers and Nrf2 expression levels in the testis. DOX injection also triggered the activation of NF-kappaB/MAPK signaling and increased levels/expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta) and inflammatory mediators (iNOS and COX-2) in the testis. DOX triggered apoptosis, manifested by an increment in the expression levels of pro-apoptotic markers (Bax, Bcl2, cleaved caspase-3 and -9, and cytochrome-C) and a decline in the expression levels of anti-apoptotic markers (Bcl-xL and Bcl2) in the testis. Additionally, light microscopy revealed the changes in testicular architecture. alpha-Bisabolol rescued alterations in the testicular weight; restored all biochemical markers; modulated the expression levels of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses, NF-kappaB/MAPK signaling, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis markers in DOX-injected testicular toxicity in rats. Based on our findings, it can be concluded that alpha-bisabolol has the potential to attenuate DOX-induced testicular injury by modifying NF-kappaB/MAPK signaling and the ER-stress-mediated mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by invoking Nrf2-dependent antioxidant defense systems in rats. Based on the findings of the present study, alpha-bisabolol could be suggested for use as an agent or adjuvant with chemotherapeutic drugs to attenuate their deleterious effects of DOX on many organs including the testis. However, further regulatory toxicology and preclinical studies are necessary before making recommendations in clinical tests.", "pmid": "36364909"}

Here, we report that CenpH, a component of the kinetochore inner plate, is responsible for G2/M transition in meiotic mouse oocytes. Depletion of CenpH by morpholino injection decreased cyclin B1 levels, resulting in attenuation of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activation, and severely compromised meiotic resumption. CenpH protects cyclin B1 from destruction by competing with the action of APC/C(Cdh1) Impaired G2/M transition after CenpH depletion could be rescued by expression of exogenous cyclin B1.

We observed the correlation between serum T/E ratio and circulating GDF15 in male depressed cohort. METHODS: The sample consisted of participants (aged 18 ~ 65 years) from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University with MDD (n = 412) defined according to a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V (SCID), and male healthy controls (n = 137). Serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, and depression risk biomarkers (thyroid hormone, lipids, hs-CRP, Tenascin-C [TNC], GDF15, KLF4, Gas6, and sgp130) were measured. The associations among log-transformed T/E ratio and these biomarkers were analyzed using univariate correlation analysis, category analyses, and linear regression adjusting for standard risk factors. RESULTS: Of the sample, 36.89% had lower T/E ratio (< 10:1) and 10.20% had higher T/E ratio (> 20:1). After multivariable adjustment, T/E ratio was negatively associated with GDF15 (-0.095 [95% CI -0.170 ~ -0.023] standard deviation [SD] change per SD increase in lg[T/E], P = 0.015) and inversely related to TNC (-0.085 [95% CI -0.167 ~ 0.003] standard deviation [SD] change per SD increase in lg[T/E], P = 0.048). Serum T/E ratio was negatively associated with GDF15 level in both FT3, TSH and HDL strata, whereas this association was not observed in TNC. In T/E ratio strata analyses, there is a significant and negative correlation among T/E ratio and GDF15 in depressive patients with sex hormone imbalance, yet this relationship was not investigated in patients with sex hormone balance. CONCLUSION: In our community-based observation, circulating GDF-15 level was greatly and inversely associated with serum T/E ratio, indicating that higher GDF-15 alerts sex hormone imbalance in patients with MDD.", "pmid": "36635686"}
{"abstract_id": "631", "title": "Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate Protects Trabecular Meshwork Cells from Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.", "abstract": "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma, for which elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor. IOP is mainly regulated by dynamic balance of aqueous humor (AH) production and outflow via the conventional trabecular meshwork/Schlemm's canal (TM/SC) pathway. Dysfunctions of TM cells due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been demonstrated to increase the resistance of AH outflow, resulting in IOP elevation. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant polyphenolic component in green tea, has been shown to alleviate ER stress in several diseases while its potential roles in alleviating ER stress in TM cells have not been determined. In this study, we investigate the mitigation of tunicamycin-induced ER stress in TM cells by EGCG. MTT assay was used to measure the cell viability of human TM (HTM) cells and primary porcine TM (PTM) cells. ER stress levels in both HTM cells and primary PTM cells were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The primary PTM cells isolated from porcine TM tissues were characterized by immunostaining. We found that 40 muM and 80 muM EGCG pretreatment substantially promoted HTM cell survival under 3 muM tunicamycin-induced ER stress. Pretreatment of 40 muM EGCG markedly reduced the expression of ER stress markers ATF4, HSPA5, and DDIT3, evoked by 3 muM tunicamycin in HTM cells. Furthermore, 40 muM EGCG pretreatment significantly decreased the expressions of ATF4, HSPA5, and DDIT3 at the mRNA level induced by 3 muM tunicamycin and improved cell viability in primary PTM cells. Our results show that EGCG is capable of protecting TM cells from ER stress. EGCG provides a promising therapeutic option for POAG treatment.", "pmid": "36406768"}

Despite the importance of nutrient-sensing pathways that detect the levels of amino acids and glucose, how the availability of these two types of nutrients is integrated is unclear. Here, we show that glucose availability regulates the central nutrient effector mTORC1 through intracellular leucine sensor leucyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (LARS1). Glucose starvation results in O-GlcNAcylation of LARS1 on residue S1042. This modification inhibits the interaction of LARS1 with RagD GTPase and reduces the affinity of LARS1 for leucine by promoting phosphorylation of its leucine-binding site by the autophagy-activating kinase ULK1, decreasing mTORC1 activity. The lack of LARS1 O-GlcNAcylation constitutively activates mTORC1, supporting its ability to sense leucine, and deregulates protein synthesis and leucine catabolism under glucose starvation. This work demonstrates that LARS1 integrates leucine and glucose availability to regulate mTORC1 and the metabolic fate of leucine.", "pmid": "35614056"}

Beyond severe physical symptoms, endometriosis is also associated with several psychiatric comorbidities, including depression and anxiety. Objective: To investigate whether pleiotropy contributes to the association of endometriosis with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: This genetic association study was performed between September 13, 2021, and June 24, 2022, in 202 276 unrelated female participants. Genotypic and phenotypic information from the UK Biobank was combined with genome-wide association statistics available from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (11 countries), the Million Veteran Program (US), the FinnGen study (Finland), and the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium (5 countries). Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were the phenotypic and genetic associations of endometriosis with anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Results: A total of 8276 women with endometriosis (mean [SD] age, 53.1 [7.9] years) and 194 000 female controls (mean [SD] age, 56.7 [7.9] years) were included in the study. In a multivariate regression analysis accounting for age, body mass index, socioeconomic status, chronic pain-related phenotypes, irritable bowel syndrome, and psychiatric comorbidities, endometriosis was associated with increased odds of depression (odds ratio [OR], 3.61; 95% CI, 3.32-3.92), eating disorders (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.96-4.41), and anxiety (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 2.30-2.97). These associations were supported by consistent genetic correlations (rg) (depression rg, 0.36, P = 1.5 x 10-9; anxiety rg, 0.33, P = 1.17 x 10-5; and eating disorders rg, 0.61, P = .02). With the application of a 1-sample mendelian randomization, the genetic liabilities to depression and anxiety were associated with increased odds of endometriosis (depression: OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08-1.11; anxiety: OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.13-1.65). A genome-wide analysis of pleiotropic associations shared between endometriosis and psychiatric disorders identified 1 locus, DGKB rs12666606, with evidence of pleiotropy between endometriosis and depression after multiple testing correction (z = -9.46 for endometriosis, z = 8.10 for depression, P = 5.56 x 10-8; false discovery rate q = 4.95 x 10-4). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings highlight that endometriosis is associated with women's mental health through pleiotropic mechanisms.

We synthesized three series of potential skin permeation enhancers derived from natural amino acid derivatives proline, 4-hydroxyproline, and pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, which is a component of natural moisturizing factor. Permeation studies using in vitro human skin identified dodecyl prolinates with N-acetyl, propionyl, and butyryl chains (Pro2, Pro3, and Pro4, respectively) as potent enhancers for model drugs theophylline and diclofenac. The proline derivatives were generally more active than 4-hydroxyprolines and pyrrolidone carboxylic acid derivatives. Pro2-4 had acceptable in vitro toxicities on 3T3 fibroblast and HaCaT cell lines with IC50 values in tens of microM. Infrared spectroscopy using the human stratum corneum revealed that these enhancers preferentially interacted with the skin barrier lipids and decreased the overall chain order without causing lipid extraction, while their effects on the stratum corneum protein structures were negligible. The impacts of Pro3 and Pro4 on an in vitro transepidermal water loss and skin electrical impedance were fully reversible. Thus, proline derivatives Pro3 and Pro4 have an advantageous combination of high enhancing potency, low cellular toxicity, and reversible action, which is important for their potential in vivo use as the skin barrier would quickly recover after the drug/enhancer administration is terminated.", "pmid": "36376455"}

Approval was based on data from SOPHIA, a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active controlled study comparing margetuximab with trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review. SOPHIA demonstrated a 0.9-month difference in median PFS between the two treatment arms [5.8 vs. 4.9 months, respectively; stratified HR, 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.98; P = 0.0334)].

However, the optimal sequencing of treatments after progression on CDK4/6i remains unknown. We performed a single-institution analysis to identify treatments and outcomes after progression on a CDK4/6i. METHODS: We identified patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative MBC prescribed a CDK4/6i in the 1L or 2L settings from December 2014 to February 2018 at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Outcomes were collected through September 30, 2020. RESULTS: Palbociclib, in combination with letrozole or fulvestrant, was the most prescribed CDK4/6i. The 1L and 2L CDK4/6i cohorts exhibited comparable overall survival (OS), but progression-free survival (PFS) was longer in the 1L than the 2L cohort [28.2 months (95% CI 19.6-34.9) vs 19.8 months (95% CI 15.7-29.6)]. The most common post-CDK4/6i treatments were PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (PI3K/mTORi), single-agent ET, or chemotherapy. PFS in the 1L CDK4/6i cohort following PI3K/mTORi was 8.5 months (95% CI 5.5 months-NE), single-agent ET was 6.0 months (95% CI 3.3-14.0 months), and chemotherapy PFS was 5.4 months (95% CI 3.3 months-NE). CONCLUSIONS: Following progression on a CDK 4/6i, mPFS was short, with similar PFS times comparing chemotherapy and ET, with slightly longer PFS for targeted strategies (PI3K/mTOR).

The study includes 778 women carrying a BRCA1 germ-line mutation belonging to 403 families. The two BRCA2 variants were analyzed by the TaqMan allelic discrimination technique. Genotypes were analyzed by disease-free survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model. We found no evidence of a significant modification of breast cancer penetrance in BRCA1 mutation carriers by either polymorphism. In respect of ovarian cancer risk, we also saw no effect with the N372H variant but we did observe a borderline association with the 5'-untranslated region 203A allele (hazard ratio, 1.43; CI, 1.01-2.00).

In addition to learning difficulties associated with the disorder's core symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, children with ADHD display substantial social impairments. Methylphenidate (MPH) in formulations such as Ritalin or Concerta mitigates inattention and hyperactivity, but the effects of the therapy on social behavior in children with ADHD are not clear. This review aims to determine the effectiveness of short term (up to 6 months) MPH treatment on three domains of social skills in children aged 6-14 with ADHD: (i) Recognition of nonverbal emotional expressions, which are a marker of inherent (unlearned) social understanding, (ii) theory of mind (ToM) components that relate to learned cognition and social communication, and (iii) social competence in everyday environments. 15 relevant studies were identified based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. The results show mixed effects: the overall social performance as evaluated by parents, teachers or peers, and some components of ToM, were found to improve following a weeks-long course of MPH treatment. However, the effects of the medication are less clear when evaluating momentary/nonverbal social responses such as reactions to emotional facial expressions.

In several organs, treatment with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) was shown to have protective effects, generally believed to be due to Ca2+ channel inhibition. However, the mechanism of 2-APB-induced cardioprotection has not been fully investigated. Herein we investigated the protective effects of 2-APB treatment against cardiac pathogenesis and deciphered the underlying mechanisms. In neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, treatment with 2-APB was shown to prevent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) -induced cell death by inhibiting the increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. However, no 2-APB-sensitive channel blocker inhibited H2O2-induced cell death and a direct reaction between 2-APB and H2O2 was detected by 1H-NMR, suggesting that 2-APB chemically scavenges extracellular ROS and provides cytoprotection. In a mouse I/R model, treatment with 2-APB led to a considerable reduction in the infarct size after I/R, which was accompanied by the reduction in ROS levels and neutrophil infiltration, indicating that the anti-oxidative properties of 2-APB plays an important role in the prevention of I/R injury in vivo as well. Taken together, present results indicate that 2-APB treatment induces cardioprotection and prevents ROS-induced cardiomyocyte death, at least partially, by the direct scavenging of extracellular ROS. Therefore, administration of 2-APB may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ROS-related cardiac pathology including I/R injury.", "pmid": "29267336"}

The purpose of the current study was to determine if increased OA severity after dietary Rap and Rap+Met was accompanied by impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial respiration and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) emissions were evaluated in permeabilized muscle fibers via high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry using either a saturating bolus or titration of ADP. Rap and Rap+Met decreased complex I (CI)-linked respiration and tended to increase ADP sensitivity, consistent with previous findings in patients with end-stage OA. The decrease in CI-linked respiration was accompanied with lower CI protein abundance. Rap and Rap+Met did not change mitochondrial H2O2 emissions. There were no differences between mitochondrial function in Rap versus Rap+Met suggesting that Rap was likely driving the change in mitochondrial function. This is the first inquiry into how lifespan extending treatments Rap and Rap+Met can influence skeletal muscle mitochondria in a model of age-related OA.

Little prospective data exist to guide the choice of either initial therapy or treatment sequence in this population. This study was conducted to determine which initial treatment or treatment sequence produced the best efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a phase III trial, patients with treatment-naive BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma were randomly assigned to receive either combination nivolumab/ipilimumab (arm A) or dabrafenib/trametinib (arm B) in step 1, and at disease progression were enrolled in step 2 to receive the alternate therapy, dabrafenib/trametinib (arm C) or nivolumab/ipilimumab (arm D). The primary end point was 2-year overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were 3-year OS, objective response rate, response duration, progression-free survival, crossover feasibility, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 265 patients were enrolled, with 73 going onto step 2 (27 in arm C and 46 in arm D). The study was stopped early by the independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee because of a clinically significant end point being achieved. The 2-year OS for those starting on arm A was 71.8% (95% CI, 62.5 to 79.1) and arm B 51.5% (95% CI, 41.7 to 60.4; log-rank P = .010). Step 1 progression-free survival favored arm A (P = .054). Objective response rates were arm A: 46.0%; arm B: 43.0%; arm C: 47.8%; and arm D: 29.6%. Median duration of response was not reached for arm A and 12.7 months for arm B (P < .001). Crossover occurred in 52% of patients with documented disease progression. Grade >= 3 toxicities occurred with similar frequency between arms, and regimen toxicity profiles were as anticipated.

{"abstract_id": "644", "title": "New Approach Methods for Hazard Identification: A Case Study with Azole Fungicides Affecting Molecular Targets Associated with the Adverse Outcome Pathway for Cholestasis.", "abstract": "Triazole fungicides such as propiconazole (Pi) or tebuconazole (Te) show hepatotoxicity in vivo, e.g., hypertrophy and vacuolization of liver cells following interaction with nuclear receptors such as PXR (pregnane-X-receptor) and CAR (constitutive androstane receptor). Accordingly, azoles affect gene expression associated with these adverse outcomes in vivo but also in human liver cells in vitro. Additionally, genes indicative of liver cholestasis are affected in vivo and in vitro. We therefore analyzed the capability of Pi and Te to cause cholestasis in an adverse outcome pathway (AOP)-driven approach in hepatic cells of human origin in vitro, considering also previous in vivo studies. Bile salt export pump (BSEP) activity assays confirmed that both azoles are weak inhibitors of BSEP. They alternate the expression of various cholestasis-associated target genes and proteins as well as the mitochondrial membrane function. Published in vivo data, however, demonstrate that neither Pi nor Te cause cholestasis in rodent bioassays. This discrepancy can be explained by the in vivo concentrations of both azoles being well below their EC50 for BSEP inhibition. From a regulatory perspective, this illustrates that toxicogenomics and human in vitro models are valuable tools to detect the potential of a substance to cause a specific type of toxicity. To come to a sound regulatory conclusion on the in vivo relevance of such a finding, results will have to be considered in a broader context also including toxicokinetics in a weight-of-evidence approach.", "pmid": "36291160"}
{"abstract_id": "645", "title": "Catalpol Regulates Oligodendrocyte Regeneration and Remyelination by Activating the GEF-Cdc42/Rac1 Signaling Pathway in EAE Mice.", "abstract": "The main obstacle to remyelination in demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, is the inability of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) in the demyelinating region. Consequently, promoting OL differentiation and myelin remodeling is a key goal in the search for treatments. Rho GTPases play diverse and important roles throughout the development of neuronal axons and the formation of the myelin sheath. The current study aimed to investigate the direct protective effects of catalpol on demyelination damage induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunization and to explore whether the GEF-Cdc42/Rac1 signaling pathway contributes to the regeneration effect induced by catalpol. In the MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of demyelination, we observed that catalpol significantly promoted OL development by enhancing the expression of glutathione S-transferase pi (GST-pi) in the affected brain. By Luxol fast blue staining and myelin basic protein (MBP) expression assessment, catalpol was found to increase MBP expression and promote myelin repair. Furthermore, catalpol promoted OL differentiation associated with the upregulation of Cdc42/Rac1 expression and activation in vivo. In addition, PAK1/MRCKalpha, proteins downstream of Cdc42/Rac1, was positively regulated by catalpol. We also found that catalpol alleviated clinical neurological dysfunction, inhibited inflammatory infiltration, increased the proportion of Treg cells, and suppressed demyelination. Overall, our study is the first to reveal that catalpol can promote OL generation and myelination and contributes to the crucial regulatory process of GEF-Cdc42/Rac1 signaling expression and activation. Therefore, catalpol is a promising drug candidate for the potential treatment of demyelinating diseases.", "pmid": "36482934"}

Of particular interest is the IKKbeta-catalyzed phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha residues Ser32 and Ser36 within a conserved destruction box motif. To investigate the catalytic mechanism of IKKbeta, we performed pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha protein substrates catalyzed by constitutively active, human IKKbeta. Phosphorylation of full-length IkappaBalpha catalyzed by IKKbeta was characterized by a fast exponential phase followed by a slower linear phase. The maximum observed rate (kp) of IKKbeta-catalyzed phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha was 0.32 s-1 and the binding affinity of ATP for the IKKbeta IkappaBalpha complex (Kd) was 12 muM. Substitution of either Ser32 or Ser36 with Ala, Asp, or Cys reduced the amplitude of the exponential phase by approximately 2-fold. Thus, the exponential phase was attributed to phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha at Ser32 and Ser36, whereas the slower linear phase was attributed to phosphorylation of other residues. Interestingly, the exponential rate of phosphorylation of the IkappaBalpha(S32D) phosphomimetic amino acid substitution mutant was nearly twice that of WT IkappaBalpha and 4-fold faster than any of the other IkappaBalpha amino acid substitution mutants, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser32 increases the phosphorylation rate of Ser36. These conclusions were supported by parallel experiments using GST-IkappaBalpha(1-54) fusion protein substrates bearing the first 54 residues of IkappaBalpha. Our data suggest a model wherein, IKKbeta phosphorylates IkappaBalpha at Ser32 followed by Ser36 within a single binding event.", "pmid": "36528060"}

The availability of standardized methods for testing the in vitro activity of antifungals along with the expanding of antifungal armamentarium, the rising of drug-resistance and the persistence of a high mortality rate in systemic candidiasis have led to an increased interest in combination therapy. Therefore, we aimed to review the scientific literature concerning the antifungal combinations against Candida. A literature search performed in PubMed yielded 92 studies published from 2000 to 2021: 29 articles referring to in vitro studies, six articles referring to either in vitro and in vivo (i.e., animal models) studies and 57 clinical articles. Pre-clinical studies involved 735 isolates of Candida species and 12 unique types of antifungal combination approaches including azoles plus echinocandins (19%), polyenes plus echinocandins (16%), polyenes plus azoles (13%), polyenes plus 5-flucytosine ([5-FC], 13%), azoles plus 5-FC (11%) and other types of combinations (28%). Results varied greatly, often being species-, drug- and methodology-dependent. Some combinatorial regimens exerted a synergistic effect against difficult-to-treat Candida species (i.e., azoles plus echinocandins; polyenes plus 5-FC) or they were more effective than monotherapy in prevent or reducing biofilm formation and in speeding the clearance of infected tissues (i.e., polyenes plus echinocandins). In 283 patients with documented Candida infections (>90% systemic candidiasis/BSI), an antifungal combination approach could be evaluated. Combinations included: azoles plus echinocandins (36%), 5-FC-combination therapies (24%), polyenes plus azoles (18%), polyenes plus echinocandins (16%) and other types of combination therapy (6%). Case reports describing combination therapies yielded favorable response in most cases, including difficult-to-treat fungal infections (i.e., endocarditis, osteoarticular infections, CNS infections) or difficult-to-treat fungal pathogens. The only randomized trial comparing amphotericin-B deoxycholate (AMB) plus FLU vs. AMB alone for treatment of BSI in nonneutropenic patients showed that the combination trended toward improved success and more-rapid clearance from the bloodstream. In summary, antifungal combinations against Candida have produced great interest in the past two decades. To establish whether this approach can become a reliable treatment option, additional in vitro and clinical data are warranted.", "pmid": "36294642"}

This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9. These 80 individuals account for approximately 75% of 109 deletions of the gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA. Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper). Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Of these, eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions.

Experimental strategies are integrated with computational approaches to analyse the pathogenicity of the TGFbeta-1 +29C/T and IL-6-174 G/C polymorphisms in HCV-induced HCC. AliBaba2 was used to predict the effect of IL-6-174 G/C on transcription factor binding site in IL-6 gene. Structural changes in the mutant TGFbeta-1 structure were determined through project HOPE. To assess the polymorphic prevalence of IL-6 -174G/C and TGFbeta-1 +29C/T genotypes in HCC and control subjects, amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR) was performed on 213 HCC and 216 control samples. GraphPad Prism version 8.0 was used for the statistical analysis of the results. In-silico analysis revealed the regulatory nature of both IL-6 -174G/C and TGFbeta-1 +29C/T polymorphisms.

MEG3, miR-214 and TXNIP mRNA expression in rat femoral tissues were detected, along with TXNIP, OPG and RANKL protein expression. BMD, BV/TV, Tb.N and Tb.Th in tissue samples were measured. Ca, P and ALP contents in rat serum were also determined. Primary osteoblasts were isolated and cultured. Viability, COL-I, COL-II and COL-Chi mRNA expression, PCNA, cyclin D1, OCN, RUNX2 and osteolix protein expresion, ALP content and activity, and mineralized nodule area of rat osteoblasts were further detected. Dual-luciferase reporter gene and RNA-pull down assays verified the targeting relationship between MEG3, miR-214 and TXNIP.

Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect (46%) on ChAT in vitro. Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana, the active component was ultimately identified as daidzein (4',7-dihydroxy-isoflavone). In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine-induced impairments of learning and memory, we conducted a series of in vivo tests. Administration of daidzein (4.5 mg/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia, according to the results of a Y-maze test. Injections of scopolamine into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y-maze tests (a 37% decreases in alternation behavior). By way of contrast, mice treated with daidzein prior to the scopolamine injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment (an approximately 12%-21% decrease in alternation behavior).

The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of mutations in this gene in BCD patients from Singapore, and to characterize their phenotype. METHODS: Nine patients with BCD from six families were recruited into the study. The 11 exons of the CYP4V2 gene were amplified from genomic DNA of patients by polymerase chain reaction and then sequenced. Detailed characterization of the patients' phenotype was performed with fundal photography, visual field testing, fundal fluorescein angiography, and electroretinography (ERG). RESULTS: Three pathogenic mutations were identified; two mutations, S482X and K386T, were novel and found in three patients. The third mutation, a previously identified 15-bp deletion that included the 3' splice site for exon 7, was found in all nine patients, with six patients carrying the deletion in the homozygous state. Haplotype analysis in patients and controls indicated a founder effect for this deletion mutation in exon 7. Clinical heterogeneity was present in the patients. Compound heterozygotes for the deletion in exon 7 seemed to have more severe disease compared to patients homozygous for the deletion. There was good correlation between clinical stage of disease and ERG changes, but age did not correlate with disease severity.

Effective treatments for reducing weight gain, other than caloric restriction and exercise, are limited. The consumption of sugars is a major factor in the development of obesity in part by stimulating the transcription factor, carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), a process that is driven by de novo lipogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibiting the action of ChREBP would be a promising strategy for alleviating these diseases. Using ChREBP deficient mice, the effect of a high intake of sucrose on body weight and blood glucose levels were investigated. Unlike wild type mice, ChREBP deficient mice did not gain much weight and their blood glucose and cholesterol levels remained relatively constant. In tracing it's cause, we found that the levels of expression of sucrase, an enzyme that digests sucrose, and both Glut2 and Glut5, a transporter of glucose and fructose, were not induced by feeding a high sucrose diet in the small intestine of ChREBP deficient mice. Our findings suggest that the inhibition of ChREBP could suppress weight gain even on a high sucrose diet.", "pmid": "36447485"}

Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) plays an important role in cardiac fibrosis. Here, we report that lactate exerts a previously unknown function that increases cardiac fibrosis and exacerbates cardiac dysfunction by promoting EndoMT following myocardial infarction (MI). Treatment of endothelial cells with lactate disrupts endothelial cell function and induces mesenchymal-like function following hypoxia by activating the TGF-beta/Smad2 pathway. Mechanistically, lactate induces an association between CBP/p300 and Snail1, leading to lactylation of Snail1, a TGF-beta transcription factor, through lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-dependent signaling. Inhibiting Snail1 diminishes lactate-induced EndoMT and TGF-beta/Smad2 activation after hypoxia/MI. The MCT inhibitor CHC mitigates lactate-induced EndoMT and Snail1 lactylation. Silence of MCT1 compromises lactate-promoted cardiac dysfunction and EndoMT after MI. We conclude that lactate acts as an important molecule that up-regulates cardiac EndoMT after MI via induction of Snail1 lactylation.", "pmid": "36735787"}

High-resolution melting curve analysis (hrMCA) has recently been developed as a post-PCR mutation scanning method which enables simple, rapid, cost-effective, and highly sensitive mutation screening of large genes. We established a hrMCA method to screen for COL3A1 mutations using genomic DNA. PCR primers pairs for COL3A1 (52 amplicons) were designed to cover all coding regions of the 52 exons, including the splicing sites. We used 15 DNA samples (8 validation samples and 7 samples of clinically suspected vEDS patients) in this study.

While the 5-year survival rate of melanoma is 99% when localized, the rate of survival drops to 22.5% when distant disease is detected. As such, an area of great interest is understanding the mechanisms that promote melanoma metastasis so that better potential therapeutic targets can be discovered. Herein, we demonstrate that activation of NRF2 by FAM129B contributes to increased metastatic potential of BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cells. Specifically, FAM129B induces NRF2 by competing for Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) binding (the negative regulator of NRF2) via an ETGE motif. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation of FAM129B plays a role in mediating the interaction between FAM129B and KEAP1, as the phosphorylation status of FAM129B dictates its subcellular localization. When phosphorylated, FAM129B is found primarily in the cytosol where it can bind to KEAP1, but upon inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase activity, FAM129B is localized to the cell membrane and no longer interacts with KEAP1. In BRAF V600E mutant melanoma, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway leads to hyperphosphorylation of FAM129B, and therefore FAM129B localizes to the cytosol, binds KEAP1, and upregulates NRF2. Importantly, genetic modulation or pharmacological inhibition that results in a decrease in FAM129B protein level or its phosphorylation decreases migration and invasion of mutant melanoma in an NRF2-dependent manner. Overall, these data indicate that phosphorylation of FAM129B plays a significant role in driving the metastatic potential of BRAF V600E melanoma via upregulation of the NRF2 signaling pathway.", "pmid": "33684228"}

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether there is an association between 3 common single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the LAG3 gene and its closely related CD4 molecule gene and the risk of PD in a Caucasian Spanish population. Two of them have been previously associated with the risk of PD in Chinese females. METHODS: We analysed genotypes and allele frequencies for CD4 rs1922452, CD4 951818 and LAG3 rs870849 SNVs, by using specifically designed TaqMan assays, in a cohort composed of 629 PD patients and 865 age- and gender-matched healthy controls.

To improve therapeutic prospects, elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial vascular failure is of essence. METHODS: Polymicrobial contamination induced sepsis mouse model and primary endothelial cells incubated with sepsis serum were used to study SHP-2 in sepsis-induced endothelial inflammation. SHP-2 activity was assessed by dephosphorylation of pNPP, ROS production was measured by DCF oxidation and protein interactions were assessed by proximity ligation assay. Vascular inflammation was studied in the mouse cremaster model and in an in vitro flow assay. FINDINGS: We identified ROS-dependent inactivation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 to be decisive for endothelial activation in sepsis. Using in vivo and in vitro sepsis models, we observed a significant reduction of endothelial SHP-2 activity, accompanied by enhanced adhesion molecule expression. The impaired SHP-2 activity was restored by ROS inhibitors and an IL-1 receptor antagonist. SHP-2 activity inversely correlated with the adhesive phenotype of endothelial cells exposed to IL-1beta as well as sepsis serum via p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB. In vivo, SHP-2 inhibition accelerated IL-1beta-induced leukocyte adhesion, extravasation and vascular permeability. Mechanistically, SHP-2 directly interacts with the IL-1R1 adaptor protein MyD88 via its tyrosine 257, resulting in reduced binding of p85/PI3-K to MyD88. INTERPRETATION: Our data show that SHP-2 inactivation by ROS in sepsis releases a protective break, resulting in endothelial activation.

In the eye, the retina is likewise protected by the blood-retina barrier (BRB) to maintain phototransduction. We showed that the secreted guidance cue Netrin-1 regulated BBB integrity, by binding to endothelial Unc5B and regulating canonical beta-catenin dependent expression of BBB gene expression. Objective: Here, we investigated if Netrin-1-binding to endothelial Unc5B also controlled BRB integrity, and if this process involved Norrin/beta-catenin signaling, which is the major known driver of BRB development and maintenance. Methods: We analyzed Tamoxifen-inducible loss- and gain-of-function alleles of Unc5B, Ntn1 and Ctnnb1 in conjunction with tracer injections and biochemical signaling studies. Results: Inducible endothelial Unc5B deletion, and inducible global Ntn1 deletion in postnatal mice reduced phosphorylation of the Norrin receptor LRP5, leading to reduced beta-catenin and LEF1 expression, conversion of retina endothelial cells from a barrier-competent Claudin-5+/PLVAP-state to a Claudin-5-/PLVAP+ leaky phenotype, and extravasation of injected low molecular weight tracers. Inducible Ctnnb1 gain of function rescued vascular leak in Unc5B mutants, and Ntn1 overexpression induced BRB tightening. Unc5B expression in pericytes contributed to BRB permeability, via regulation of endothelial Unc5B. Mechanistically, Netrin-1-Unc5B signaling promoted beta-catenin dependent BRB signaling by enhancing phosphorylation of the Norrin receptor LRP5 via the Discs large homologue 1 (Dlg1) intracellular scaffolding protein. Conclusions: The data identify Netrin1-Unc5B as novel regulators of BRB integrity, with implications for diseases associated with BRB disruption.", "pmid": "36711611"}

A cross-sectional study of 847 patients with HIV was conducted. Patients provided blood samples for HBsAg detection. The load of HBV was determined using an \"in-house\" real-time polymerase chain reaction. HBV genotypes/subgenotypes, antiviral resistance, basal core promoter (BCP), and precore mutations were detected by DNA sequencing. Twenty-eight patients with co-infection were identified. The distribution of HBV genotypes among these patients was A (n = 9; 50%), D (n = 4; 22.2%), G (n = 3; 16.7%), and F (n = 2; 11.1%). Eighteen patients were treated with LAM and six patients were treated with LAM plus TDF. The length of exposure to LAM and TDF varied from 4 to 216 months. LAM resistance substitutions (rtL180M + rtM204V) were detected in 10 (50%) of the 20 patients with viremia. This pattern and an accompanying rtV173L mutation was found in four patients. Three patients with the triple polymerase substitution pattern (rtV173L + rtL180M + rtM204V) had associated changes in the envelope gene (sE164D + sI195M). Mutations in the BCP region (A1762T, G1764A) and in the precore region (G1896A, G1899A) were also found. No putative TDF resistance substitution was detected.

However, in chronic obesity, they can exhibit an activated pro-fibrotic, extracellular matrix (ECM)-depositing phenotype that highly aggravates obesity-related adipose tissue dysfunction. METHODS: Given that progenitors' fibrotic activation and fat cell browning appear to be antagonistic cell fates, we have examined the anti-fibrotic potential of pro-browning agents in an obesogenic condition. RESULTS: In obese mice fed a high fat diet, thermoneutral housing, which induces brown fat cell dormancy, increases the expression of ECM gene programs compared to conventionally raised animals, indicating aggravation of obesity-related tissue fibrosis at thermoneutrality. In a model of primary cultured murine adipose progenitors, we found that exposure to beta-hydroxybutyrate selectively reduced Tgfbeta-dependent profibrotic responses of ECM genes like Ctgf, Loxl2 and Fn1. This effect is observed in both subcutaneous and visceral-derived adipose progenitors, as well as in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. In 30 patients with obesity eligible for bariatric surgery, those with higher circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate levels have lower subcutaneous adipose tissue fibrotic scores. Mechanistically, beta-hydroxybutyrate limits Tgfbeta-dependent collagen accumulation and reduces Smad2-3 protein expression and phosphorylation in visceral progenitors. Moreover, beta-hydroxybutyrate induces the expression of the ZFP36 gene, encoding a post-transcriptional regulator that promotes the degradation of mRNA by binding to AU-rich sites within 3'UTRs. Importantly, complete ZFP36 deficiency in a mouse embryonic fibroblast line from null mice, or siRNA knock-down in primary progenitors, indicate that ZFP36 is required for beta-hydroxybutyrate anti-fibrotic effects. CONCLUSION: These data unravel the potential of beta-hydroxybutyrate to limit adipose tissue matrix deposition, a finding that might exploited in an obesogenic context.", "pmid": "35550189"}

Beyond electrolyte balance, an increasing body of evidence points to new roles for chloride in normal physiology and disease. Over the last two decades, this understanding has been advanced by chloride-sensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging applications in living cells. To our surprise, these sensors have primarily been engineered from the green fluorescent protein (GFP) found in the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. However, the GFP family has a rich sequence space that could already encode for new sensors with desired properties, thereby minimizing protein engineering efforts and accelerating biological applications. To efficiently sample this space, we present and validate a stepwise bioinformatics strategy focused first on the chloride binding pocket and second on a monomeric oligomerization state. Using this, we identified GFPxm163 from GFPxm found in the jellyfish Aequorea macrodactyla. In vitro characterization shows that the binding of chloride as well as bromide, iodide, and nitrate rapidly tunes the ground state chromophore equilibrium from the phenolate to the phenol state generating a pH-dependent, turn-off fluorescence response. Furthermore, live-cell fluorescence microscopy reveals that GFPxm163 provides a reversible, yet indirect readout of chloride transport via iodide exchange. With this demonstration, we anticipate that the pairing of bioinformatics with protein engineering methods will provide an efficient methodology to discover and design new chloride-sensitive fluorescent proteins for cellular applications.", "pmid": "36519056"}

Ibuprofen inhibits Rho activation in animal models of spinal-cord injury and Alzheimer's disease. The study aims to investigate ibuprofen effects on high tidal volume associated VILI. METHODS: Twenty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive a ventilation strategy with three different interventions for 2 h: (1) a high-volume zero-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (HVZP) group; (2) an HVZP + ibuprofen 15 mg/kg group; and (3) an HVZP + ibuprofen 30 mg/kg group. A fourth group without ventilation served as the control group. Rho-kinase activity was determined by ratio of phosphorylated ezrin, radixin, and moesin (p-ERM), substrates of Rho-kinase, to total ERM. VILI was characterized by increased pulmonary protein leak, wet-to-dry weight ratio, cytokines level, and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF-H1), RhoA activity, p-ERM/total ERM, and p-myosin light chain (MLC) protein expression.

OBJECTIVE: Two randomized, double-blinded, split-face trials aimed to demonstrate noninferiority of specific hyaluronic acid fillers incorporating mepivacaine (RHA-M) versus their lidocaine controls, at providing pain relief. METHODS: Thirty subjects per trial received injections of RHA R -M versus RHA R , and RHA4-M versus RHA4, respectively, in the perioral rhytids (PR) and nasolabial folds (NLF). Pain was assessed on a visual analog scale; aesthetic effectiveness was evaluated with validated scales, and safety was monitored based on common treatment responses (CTRs) and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: RHA-M fillers proved as effective as their lidocaine counterparts at reducing pain (noninferior, p < .0002 and p < .0001). Bilateral wrinkle improvement was measured both in the PR (-1.5 +- 0.6 points on each side) and in the NLF (-1.8 +- 0.6 and -1.9 +- 0.5 points) trials at one month, with virtually identical responder rates (>=96.7%).

The heterogeneity across studies was tested using the I2 statistic and the quality of studies was assessed. The pooled evaluation of outcomes was calculated using a fix- or random-effect model according to the heterogeneity. The underlying mechanism of DHI in treating COPD was analyzed using network pharmacology. RESULTS: A total of 34 eligible studies with a general medium quality were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled data showed that DHI intervention significantly increased clinical efficacy as compared to routine treatment. Meanwhile, our data also revealed that the addition of DHI markedly improved hemorheological indicators, lung function index, arterial blood gas index, and as well as blood coagulation functions.

Our study was conducted to evaluate the effect of MUFAs-enriched-camellia seed oil (CSO) on alcohol-induced liver injury. The ALD model was established by feeding C57BL/6 mice with Lieber-DeCarli diet, and with either CSO or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)-enriched-corn oil (CO) as fat source. After 4-week-intervention, CSO-feed rescued alcohol-induced liver injury compared to CO-feed, evidenced by measurements of plasma ALT activity, H&E stain, and hepatic cleaved-Caspase-3 expression. Besides, CSO-feed alleviated alcohol-induced oxidative stress, associated with NRF2 and Hif-1alpha expressions improvement. The reduction of F4/80 immunostaining and the decreased expressions of hepatic TNF-alpha and IL-6 suggested CSO-feed improved alcohol-induced inflammation. The mechanistic analysis showed that the inhibition of ASK1 and MAPKs might contribute to CSO-protected liver injury.

Despite significant breakthroughs in standard treatment, only about 5% of patients survive 5 years or longer. Therefore, much effort has been put into the search for identifying new glioma-associated genes. Tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) family proteins are essential regulators of carcinogenesis. TRIM8, a member of the TRIM superfamily, is abnormally expressed in high-grade gliomas and is associated with poor clinical prognosis in patients with glioma. Recent research has shown that TRIM8 is a molecule of duality (MoD) that can function as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor gene, making it a \"double-edged sword\" in glioblastoma development. This characteristic is due to its role in selectively regulating three major cellular signaling pathways: the TP53/p53-mediated tumor suppression pathway, NFKB/NF-kappaB, and the JAK-STAT pathway essential for stem cell property support in glioma stem cells. In this review, TRIM8 is analyzed in detail in the context of GBM and its involvement in essential signaling and stem cell-related pathways.

Metabolic function powered by glucose transporter isoform 1 (Glut1) is necessary for macrophage activity during inflammation. The present study investigated the roles of cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) and its byproduct, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), in macrophage glucose metabolism to explore the mechanism by which H2S acts as an inflammatory regulator in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS) induced macrophages. Our results demonstrated that LPS-treated macrophages increased Glut1 expression. LPS-induced Glut1 expression is regulated via nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation and is associated with phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase PI3k activation. Small interfering (si) RNA-mediated silencing of CSE decreased the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation and Glut1 expression, suggesting a role for H2S in metabolic function in macrophages during pro-inflammatory response. Confoundingly, treatment with GYY4137, an H2S-donor molecule, also displayed inhibitory effects upon LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation and Glut1 expression. Moreover, GYY4137 treatment increased Akt activation, suggesting a role in promoting resolution of inflammation. Our study provides evidence that the source of H2S, either endogenous (via CSE) or exogenous (via GYY4137), supports or inhibits the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activity and Glut1 expression, respectively. Therefore, H2S may influence metabolic programming in immune cells to alter glucose substrate availability that impacts the immune response.", "pmid": "36520801"}

Thus, they provide a critical point for therapeutic intervention. However, due to their intrinsically disordered structure, they are challenging to target directly. Since YAP/TAZ exerts oncogenic activity by associating with the TEAD1-4 transcription factors, to regulate target gene expression, YAP activity can be controlled indirectly by regulating TEAD1-4. Interestingly, TEADs undergo autopalmitoylation, which is essential for their stability and function, and small-molecule inhibitors that prevent this posttranslational modification can render them unstable. In this article we report discovery of a novel small molecule inhibitor of YAP activity. We combined structure-based virtual ligand screening with biochemical and cell biological studies and identified JM7, which inhibits YAP transcriptional reporter activity with an IC50 of 972 nMoles/Ltr. Further, it inhibits YAP target gene expression, without affecting YAP/TEAD localization. Mechanistically, JM7 inhibits TEAD palmitoylation and renders them unstable. Cellular thermal shift assay revealed that JM7 directly binds to TEAD1-4 in cells. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of JM7 on YAP activity, it significantly impairs proliferation, colony-formation and migration of mesothelioma (NCI-H226), breast (MDA-MB-231) and ovarian (OVCAR-8) cancer cells that exhibit increased YAP activity. Collectively, these results establish JM7 as a novel lead compound for development of more potent inhibitors of TEAD palmitoylation for treating cancer.", "pmid": "36523977"}

In this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain RAS in the cardiac reactivity to the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) agonist isoproterenol (Iso). Transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen (TGR) were used. In isolated hearts, Iso induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular (LV) pressure and maximal contraction (+dP/dt(max)) in the TGR than in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. LV hypertrophy induced by Iso treatment was significantly higher in TGR than in SD rats (in g LV wt/100 g body wt, 0.28 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.24 +/- 0.004, respectively). The greater LV hypertrophy in TGR rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta-AR and upregulation of LV beta-AR kinase-1 mRNA levels compared with those in SD rats. The decrease in the heart rate (HR) induced by the beta-AR antagonist metoprolol in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in TGR compared with SD rats (-9.9 +/- 1.7% vs. -18.1 +/- 1.5%), whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by atropine on HR was similar in both strains. These results indicate that TGR are more sensitive to beta-AR agonist-induced cardiac inotropic response and hypertrophy, possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart.", "pmid": "16731636"}

Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy is commonly used in HNSCC, frequent development of cisplatin resistance is a potential cause of poor HNSCC prognosis. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer efficacy of a major paclitaxel metabolite namely 7-Epitaxol in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC. The findings revealed that 7-Epitaxol exerts cytotoxic effects in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cell lines by inducing cell cycle arrest and intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Specifically, 7-Epitaxol increased Fas, TNF-R1, DR5, DcR3 and DcR2 expressions, reduced Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (anti-apoptotic proteins) expressions, and increased Bid and Bim L/S (pre-apoptotic proteins) expressions, leading to activation of caspase-mediated cancer cell apoptosis. At the upstream cell signalling level, 7-Epitaxol reduced the phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2 and p38 to trigger apoptosis. In vivo results showed that animals treated with 7-Epitaxol show antitumor growth compared to control animals. Taken together, the study demonstrates the potential anticancer efficacy of 7-Epitaxol in inducing apoptosis of cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cells through the suppression of AKT and MAPK signalling pathways.", "pmid": "36308422"}

Fibrinogen consists of three pairs of non-identical polypeptide chains, encoded by different genes (fibrinogen alpha [FGA], fibrinogen beta [FGB] and fibrinogen gamma [FGG]). A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3' untranslated region of the FGG gene (FGG 10034C>T, rs2066865) has been associated with deep venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Aim of the present study was to analyze the role of this polymorphism in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The study was designed as case-control study including 891 patients with documented PAD and 777 control subjects. FGG genotypes were determined by exonuclease (TaqMan) assays. FGG genotype frequencies were not significantly different between PAD patients (CC: 57.3%, CT: 36.7%, TT: 5.8%) and control subjects (CC: 60.9%, CT: 33.5%, TT 5.6%; p=0.35). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis including age, sex, smoking, diabetes, arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, the FGG 10034 T variant was not significantly associated with the presence of PAD (Odds ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.84 - 1.37; p = 0.60). The FGG 10034C>T polymorphism was furthermore not associated with age at onset of PAD.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 50 children with SCD above 2 y of age followed up at the hematology outpatient clinic of Alexandria University Children's Hospital in Egypt. Twenty-four healthy children were included as a control group. All patients included in the study were subjected to complete history and clinical examination. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on patients and controls for identification of SNP rs284875 of the TGFBR3 gene. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were performed only on patients for detection of SCI. RESULTS: Fifty SCD patients were enrolled (26 males and 24 females), with a median age of 10.9 y (2.3-17.8 y), and 24 children as healthy control for the studied SNP. Thirty-five (70%) patients had homozygous SCD, while 30% had sickle beta-thalassemia. The brain MRI was normal in all the patients except for 2 patients who had features of SCI. The TGFBR3 rs284875 SNP was detected in 15 (30%) patients in the homozygous state (GG) versus only 1 (4.2%) child from the control group (p = 0.003). The prevalence of SCI was low in the study population and there was no statistically significant relationship between the TGFBR3 rs284875 SNP status and the presence of SCI in the brain MRI (p = 0.621). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed a low prevalence of SCI in the SCD patient included in the study.

Offspring of IT balanced carriers are at high risk to have either pure partial trisomy or monosomy for the inserted segment as manifested by \"pure\" phenotypes. We describe an IT between chromosomes 3 and 13 segregating in a three-generation pedigree. Short tandem repeat (STR) segregation analysis and array-comparative genomic hybridization were used to define the IT as a 25.1 Mb segment spanning 13q21.2-q31.1. The phenotype of pure monosomy included deafness, duodenal stenosis, developmental and growth delay, vertebral anomalies, and facial dysmorphisms; the trisomy was manifested by only minor dysmorphisms. As the AUNA1 deafness locus on 13q14-21 overlaps the IT in the PCDH9 (protocadherin-9) gene region, PCDH9 was investigated as a candidate gene for deafness in both families. Genotyping of STRs and single nucleotide polymorphisms defined the AUNA1 breakpoint as 35 kb 5' to PCDH9, with a 2.4 Mb area of overlap with the IT. DNA sequencing of coding regions in the AUNA1 family and in the retained homologue chromosome in the monosomic patient revealed no mutations. We conclude that AUNA1 deafness does not share a common etiology with deafness associated with monosomy 13q21.2-q31.3; deafness may result from monosomy of PCHD9 or another gene in the IT, as has been demonstrated in contiguous gene deletion syndromes. Precise characterization of the breakpoints of the translocated region is useful to identify which genes may be contributing to the phenotype, either through haploinsufficiency or extra dosage effects, in order to define genotype-phenotype correlations.", "pmid": "19353688"}

Preeclampsia is characterized by high soluble endoglin (sEng) concentration in plasma and coincides with intrahepatic cholestasis during pregnancy (ICP), which threatens the fetus with the toxicity of cumulating bile acids (BA). Therefore, we hypothesized that both labetalol and increased sEng levels worsen BA cumulation in estrogen-induced cholestasis. C57BL/6J, transgenic mice overexpressing human sEng, and their wild-type littermates were administrated with ethinylestradiol (EE, 10 mg/kg s.c., the mice model of ICP) and labetalol (10 mg/kg s.c.) for 5 days with sample collection and analysis. Plasma was also taken from healthy pregnant women and patients with ICP. Administration of labetalol to mice with EE cholestasis aggravated the increase in BA plasma concentrations by induction of hepatic Mrp4 efflux transporter. Labetalol potentiated the increment of sEng plasma levels induced by estrogen. Increased plasma levels of sEng were also observed in patients with ICP. Moreover, increased plasma levels of human sEng in transgenic mice aggravated estrogen-induced cholestasis in labetalol-treated mice and increased BA concentration in plasma via enhanced reabsorption of BAs in the ileum due to the upregulation of the Asbt transporter. In conclusion, we demonstrated that labetalol increases plasma concentrations of BAs in estrogen-induced cholestasis, and sEng aggravates this retention. Importantly, increased sEng levels in experimental and clinical forms of ICPs might present a novel mechanism explaining the coincidence of ICP with preeclampsia. Our data encourage BA monitoring in the plasma of pregnant women with preeclampsia and labetalol therapy.", "pmid": "36778021"}

Haplotype analysis and mutational screening on the RPGR gene were performed. Additionally, samples of hair follicles and buccal cells from the mother of the proband were acquired for DNA extraction and molecular analysis. Phenotype was characterized with routine ophthalmic examination, Goldmann perimetry, electroretinography, and color fundus photography. A g.ORF15 + 652-653delAG mutation was identified in second- and third-generation patients/carriers. A first-generation female, who was considered to be an obligate carrier, demonstrated a normal phenotype as well as a normal genotype in lymphocytic DNA, indicating the gonadal mosaicism; however, a heterozygous AG-deletion at nucleotide 652 and 653 was identified in the genomic DNA of hair follicles, hair shaft, and buccal cells, indicating that the mutation is somatic. In conclusion, we reported on a family in which an asymptomatic woman with somatic-gonadal mosaicism for a RPGR gene mutation transmitted the mutation to an asymptomatic daughter and to a son with XLRP.

Despite an increasing knowledge about molecular markers and their diagnostic and prognostic value, they are not used as much as they might be for treatment allocation. It has been recently reported that mesothelioma cells that lack BAP1 (BRCA1 Associated Protein) are sensitive to inhibition of the EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2) histone methyltransferase. Since we observed strong H3K27me3 (histone H3 lysine 27 trimetylation) immunoreactivity in BAP1 wild-type mesothelioma biopsies, we decided to characterize in vitro the response/resistance of BAP1 wild-type mesothelioma cells to the EZH2 selective inhibitor, EPZ-6438. Here we demonstrate that BAP1 wild-type mesothelioma cells were rendered sensitive to EPZ-6438 upon SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1) silencing/inhibition or when cultured as multicellular spheroids, in which SIRT1 expression was lower compared to cells grown in monolayers. Notably, treatment of spheroids with EPZ-6438 abolished H3K27me3 and induced the expression of CDKN2A (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A), causing cell growth arrest. EPZ-6438 treatment also resulted in a rapid and sustained induction of the genes encoding HIF2alpha (Hypoxia Inducible Factor 2alpha), TG2 (Transglutaminase 2) and IL-6 (Interleukin 6). Loss of CDKN2 is a common event in mesothelioma. CDKN2A silencing in combination with EPZ-6438 treatment induced apoptotic death in mesothelioma spheroids. In a CDKN2A wild-type setting apoptosis was induced by combining EPZ-6438 with 1-155, a TG2 selective and irreversible inhibitor. In conclusion, our data suggests that the expression of CDKN2A predicts cell fate in response to EZH2 inhibition and could potentially stratify tumors likely to undergo apoptosis.", "pmid": "34277422"}

The major clinical entities are represented by polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), that are caused by driver mutations affecting JAK2, MPL or CALR. Disease progression is related to molecular and clonal evolution. PV and ET can progress to secondary myelofibrosis (sMF) but can also evolve to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). PMF is associated with the highest frequency of leukemic transformation, which represents the main cause of death. sAML is associated with a dismal prognosis and clinical features that differ from those of de novo AML. The molecular landscape distinguishes sAML from de novo AML, since the most frequent hits involve TP53, epigenetic regulators, spliceosome modulators or signal transduction genes. Single cell genomic studies provide novel and accurate information about clonal architecture and mutation acquisition order, allowing the reconstruction of clonal dynamics and molecular events that accompany leukemic transformation. In this review, we examine our current understanding of the genomic heterogeneity in MPNs and how it affects disease progression and leukemic transformation.

We investigated whether the IL12B polymorphisms within the promoter region (4 bp insertion/deletion) and the 3'-UTR (1188-A/C), which have been reported to influence IL-12 synthesis, are associated with the outcome of HCV infection. METHODS: We analyzed 186 individuals with spontaneous HCV clearance, 501 chronically HCV infected patients, and 217 healthy controls. IL12B 3'-UTR and promoter genotyping was performed by Taqman-based assays with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes and PCR-based allele-specific DNA-amplification, respectively. RESULTS: The proportion of IL12B promoter and 3'-UTR genotypes did not differ significantly between the different cohorts.

{"abstract_id": "693", "title": "Local production of lactate, ribose phosphate, and amino acids within human triple-negative breast cancer.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Upregulated glucose metabolism is a common feature of tumors. Glucose can be broken down by either glycolysis or the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP). The relative usage within tumors of these catabolic pathways remains unclear. Similarly, the extent to which tumors make biomass precursors from glucose, versus take them up from the circulation, is incompletely defined. METHODS: We explore human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) metabolism by isotope tracing with [1,2-13C]glucose, a tracer that differentiates glycolytic versus oxPPP catabolism and reveals glucose-driven anabolism. Patients enrolled in clinical trial NCT03457779 and received IV infusion of [1,2-13C]glucose during core biopsy of their primary TNBC. Tumor samples were analyzed for metabolite labeling by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Genomic and proteomic analyses were performed and related to observed metabolic fluxes. FINDINGS: TNBC ferments glucose to lactate, with glycolysis dominant over the oxPPP. Most ribose phosphate is nevertheless produced by oxPPP. Glucose also feeds amino acid synthesis, including of serine, glycine, aspartate, glutamate, proline and glutamine (but not asparagine). Downstream in glycolysis, tumor pyruvate and lactate labeling exceeds that found in serum, indicating that lactate exchange via monocarboxylic transporters is less prevalent in human TNBC compared with most normal tissues or non-small cell lung cancer.

This was associated with upper and lower eyelid edema and conjunctival inflammation. The conjunctiva is composed of a proliferating epithelium largely consisting of stratified columnar epithelial cells overlying a well-defined dermis. Superficial layers of the conjunctival epithelium were found to express keratin 1, a marker of differentiating squamous epithelium, while in cells overlying the basement membrane expressed keratin 17, a marker of stratified squamous epithelium. SM exposure upregulated keratin 17 expression. Mucin 5 ac producing goblet cells were interspersed within the conjunctiva. These cells generated both acidic and neutral mucins. Increased numbers of goblet cells producing neutral mucins were evident after SM exposure; upregulation of expression of membrane-associated mucin 1 and mucin 4 in the superficial layers of the conjunctival epithelium were also noted.

The decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium acutely disrupting the cAMP pathway and chronically reducing urea transporter (UT-A1) and water channel (AQP2) expression in the inner medulla. Targeting an alternative signaling pathway, such as PKC-mediated signaling, may be an effective method of treating lithium-induced polyuria. PKC-alpha null mice (PKCa KO) and strain-matched wild type (WT) controls were treated with lithium for 0, 3 or 5 days. WT mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas PKCa KO mice had no change in urine output or concentration. Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in WT mice; however, AQP2 was unchanged in PKCa KO. Similar results were observed with UT-A1 expression. Animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks. Lithium-treated WT mice had 19-fold increased urine output whereas treated PKCa KO animals had a 4-fold increase in output. AQP2 and UT-A1 expression was lowered in 6 week lithium-treated WT animals whereas in treated PKCa KO mice, AQP2 was only reduced by 2-fold and UT-A1 expression was unaffected. Urinary sodium, potassium and calcium were elevated in lithium-fed WT but not in lithium-fed PKCa KO mice.

Nucleoplasmic Ca2+ regulates gene expression, but the nature and significance of nuclear Ca2+-changes in AF are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate mechanisms by which AF alters atrial-cardiomyocyte nuclear Ca2+ ([Ca2+]Nuc) and CaMKII (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II)-related signaling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Atrial cardiomyocytes were isolated from control and AF dogs (kept in AF by atrial tachypacing [600 bpm x 1 week]). [Ca2+]Nuc and cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]Cyto) were recorded via confocal microscopy. Diastolic [Ca2+]Nuc was greater than [Ca2+]Cyto under control conditions, while resting [Ca2+]Nuc was similar to [Ca2+]Cyto; both diastolic and resting [Ca2+]Nuc increased with AF. IP3R (Inositol-trisphosphate receptor) stimulation produced larger [Ca2+]Nuc increases in AF versus control cardiomyocytes, and IP3R-blockade suppressed the AF-related [Ca2+]Nuc differences. AF upregulated nuclear protein expression of IP3R1 (IP3R-type 1) and of phosphorylated CaMKII (immunohistochemistry and immunoblot) while decreasing the nuclear/cytosolic expression ratio for HDAC4 (histone deacetylase type-4). Isolated atrial cardiomyocytes tachypaced at 3 Hz for 24 hours mimicked AF-type [Ca2+]Nuc changes and L-type calcium current decreases versus 1-Hz-paced cardiomyocytes; these changes were prevented by IP3R knockdown with short-interfering RNA directed against IP3R1. Nuclear/cytosolic HDAC4 expression ratio was decreased by 3-Hz pacing, while nuclear CaMKII phosphorylation was increased. Either CaMKII-inhibition (by autocamtide-2-related peptide) or IP3R-knockdown prevented the CaMKII-hyperphosphorylation and nuclear-to-cytosolic HDAC4 shift caused by 3-Hz pacing. In human atrial cardiomyocytes from AF patients, nuclear IP3R1-expression was significantly increased, with decreased nuclear/nonnuclear HDAC4 ratio. MicroRNA-26a was predicted to target ITPR1 (confirmed by luciferase assay) and was downregulated in AF atrial cardiomyocytes; microRNA-26a silencing reproduced AF-induced IP3R1 upregulation and nuclear diastolic Ca2+-loading. CONCLUSIONS: AF increases atrial-cardiomyocyte nucleoplasmic [Ca2+] by IP3R1-upregulation involving miR-26a, leading to enhanced IP3R1-CaMKII-HDAC4 signaling and L-type calcium current downregulation.

Cargo recycling by SNX27 requires its interaction with retromer, a heterotrimer known to assemble on membranes with multiple sorting nexins, including SNX-BAR proteins and SNX3. SNX27 has also been functionally linked to SNX-BARs, but the molecular basis of this interaction has been unknown. We identify a direct biochemical interaction between the conserved and flexible SNX1/SNX2 N-terminus and full-length SNX27 using purified proteins in pulldown experiments. Sequence alignments indicate both SNX1 and SNX2 contain two short and conserved stretches of acidic residues bearing a DxF motif in their flexible N-terminal regions. Biochemical pulldown and mapping experiments reveal forty residues in the N-terminus of either SNX1 or SNX2 can mediate binding to SNX27. SNX27 truncation analysis demonstrates the SNX27 FERM domain binds the SNX1 N-terminus. Calorimetry experiments quantified binding between the SNX1 N-terminus and SNX27 in the low micromolar affinity range (KD ~10 muM) and suggest the second DxF motif may play a more prominent role in binding. Mutation of either DxF sequence in SNX1 abrogates measurable binding to SNX27 in the calorimeter. Modelling from both predicted and experimentally determined structures suggests the SNX27 FERM domain could accommodate both DxF motifs simultaneously. Together, these data suggest SNX27 is directly linked to specific SNX-BAR proteins through binding acidic motifs in the SNX1 or SNX2 N-terminus.", "pmid": "34866035"}

During the methionine cycle, the vitamin B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthetase converts homocysteine to methionine. The enzyme S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase then uses methionine in the production of the reactive methyl carrier SAM. SAM-binding methyltransferases then utilise SAM as a cofactor to methylate proteins, small molecules, lipids, and nucleic acids. RESULTS: We describe a novel SAM methyltransferase, RIPS-1, which was the single gene identified from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans looking for resistance to lethal concentrations of the thiol-reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). As well as RIPS-1 mutation, we show that in wild-type worms, DTT toxicity can be overcome by modulating vitamin B12 levels, either by using growth media and/or bacterial food that provide higher levels of vitamin B12 or by vitamin B12 supplementation. We show that active methionine synthetase is required for vitamin B12-mediated DTT resistance in wild types but is not required for resistance resulting from RIPS-1 mutation and that susceptibility to DTT is partially suppressed by methionine supplementation. A targeted RNAi modifier screen identified the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase as a strong genetic enhancer of DTT resistance in a RIPS-1 mutant. We show that RIPS-1 is expressed in the intestinal and hypodermal tissues of the nematode and that treating with DTT, beta-mercaptoethanol, or hydrogen sulfide induces RIPS-1 expression. We demonstrate that RIPS-1 expression is controlled by the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway and that homologues of RIPS-1 are found in a small subset of eukaryotes and bacteria, many of which can adapt to fluctuations in environmental oxygen levels. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the central importance of dietary vitamin B12 in normal metabolic processes in C. elegans, defines a new role for this vitamin in countering reductive stress, and identifies RIPS-1 as a novel methyltransferase in the methionine cycle.", "pmid": "36209095"}

While gene-wide association studies and next generation sequencing analyses have identified molecular patterns and transcriptome profiles with prognostic relevance, therapeutic opportunities remain limited. Among the genes that are upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine belonging to IL-6 family, has emerged as potential therapeutic candidate. LIF is aberrantly secreted by tumour cells and promotes tumour progression in pancreatic and other solid tumours through aberrant activation of the LIF receptor (LIFR) and downstream signalling that involves the JAK1/STAT3 pathway. Since there are no LIFR antagonists available for clinical use, we developed an in silico strategy to identify potential LIFR antagonists and drug repositioning with regard to LIFR antagonists. The results of these studies allowed the identification of mifepristone, a progesterone/glucocorticoid antagonist, clinically used in medical abortion, as a potent LIFR antagonist. Computational studies revealed that mifepristone binding partially overlapped the LIFR binding site. LIF and LIFR are expressed by human PDAC tissues and PDAC cell lines, including MIA-PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Exposure of these cell lines to mifepristone reverses cell proliferation, migration and epithelial mesenchymal transition induced by LIF in a concentration-dependent manner. Mifepristone inhibits LIFR signalling and reverses STAT3 phosphorylation induced by LIF. Together, these data support the repositioning of mifepristone as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of PDAC.", "pmid": "36359879"}

Paricalcitol is a biologically active chemical that binds to vitamin D receptors in the body to exert anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the molecular mechanism of the effect of paricalcitol on AKI remains unclear. The current study uses a paricalcitol pretreatment with a mouse AKI model induced by cisplatin to detect changes in renal function, pathology and ultrastructure. Results showed that paricalcitol significantly improved renal function in mice and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and mitochondrial damage in renal tissue. Furthermore, paricalcitol markedly suppressed reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde levels in the kidneys of AKI mice and increased the levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, Catalase and total anti-oxidant capacity. In addition, we detected renal necrosis and inflammation-related proteins in AKI mice by immunofluorescence and Western blot, and found that their levels were markedly decreased after paricalcitol pretreatment. Moreover, paricalcitol promotes nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the nucleus and activates the Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway; while HO-1 is inhibited, the protective effect of paricalcitol on the kidney is attenuated. In conclusion, paricalcitol exerts a renoprotective effect by decreasing renal oxidative injury and inflammation through Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, providing a new insight into AKI prevention.", "pmid": "36674485"}

The GBA gene encodes for the lysosomal hydrolase enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GBA mutations often reduce GCase activity and lead to impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, which is important in the turnover of alpha-synuclein, accumulation of which is a key pathological hallmark of PD. Although the E326K variant is one of the most common GBA variants associated with PD, there is limited understanding of its biochemical effects. We have characterised homozygous and heterozygous E326K variants in human fibroblasts. We found that E326K variants did not cause significant loss of GCase protein or activity, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention or ER stress, in contrast to the L444P GBA mutation. This was confirmed in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines over-expressing GCase with either E326K or L444P protein. Despite no loss of GCase activity, a significant increase of insoluble alpha-synuclein aggregates in E326K and L444P mutants was observed. Notably, SH-SY5Y over-expressing E326K demonstrated a significant increase in lipid droplet number under basal conditions, which was exacerbated following treatment with the fatty acid oleic acid. Similarly, a significant increase in lipid droplet formation following lipid loading was observed in heterozygous and homozygous E326K fibroblasts. In conclusion, the work presented here demonstrates that the E326K mutation behaves differently to common loss of function GBA mutations, however lipid dyshomeostasis and alpha-synuclein pathology is still evident.", "pmid": "36130205"}

In both COVID-19 cases, neurological physical examinations showed normal results before infection. Lymphocytopenia, accompanied by elevated cytokines and D-dimers, were found from serum clinical laboratory examination at admission. Dysarthria and limb muscle weakness are initial manifestations, occurring one week after infect-causative pathogen, SARS-CoV-2. The head CT and head/neck arterial CTA showed small-vessel occlusion. The patients were diagnosed with coronavirus diseases with secondary acute ischemic stroke. They were treated with tirofiban and followed up with daily aspirin and atorvastatin.

Our aim was to analyze the severity of COVID-19 in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) on TDF or entecavir (ETV). METHODS: Spanish hospital databases (n = 28) including information regarding adult CHB patients on TDF or ETV for the period February 1st to November 30th 2020 were searched for COVID-19, defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction, and for severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 4736 patients, 117 had COVID-19 (2.5%), 67 on TDF and 50 on ETV. Compared to patients on TDF, those on ETV showed (p < 0.05) greater rates of obesity, diabetes, ischemic cardiopathy, and hypertension. COVID-19 incidence was similar in both groups (2.3 vs. 2.6%). Compared to TDF, patients on ETV more often (p < 0.01) had severe COVID-19 (36 vs. 6%), required intensive care unit (ICU) (10% vs. 0) or ventilatory support (20 vs. 3%), were hospitalized for longer (10.8 +- 19 vs. 3.1 +- 7 days) or died (10 vs. 1.5%, p = 0.08). In an IPTW propensity score analysis adjusted for age, sex, obesity, comorbidities, and fibrosis stage, TDF was associated with a sixfold reduction in severe COVID-19 risk (adjusted-IPTW-OR 0.17, 95%CI 0.04-0.67, p = 0.01).

In a microdialysis study, 10 muL of saline (group C; n = 8) or 30 mug of morphine (group M; n = 8) was injected intrathecally (IT) 0.5 h after reflow, and 30 mug of morphine (group SM; n = 8) or 10 muL of saline (group SC; n = 8) was injected IT 0.5 h after sham operation. Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia, before IT injection, and at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of reperfusion (after IT injection). Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK-801 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis. After IT morphine, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C (P < 0.05). This increase persisted for 8 hrs. IT MK-801 significantly reduced the number of dark-stained alpha-motoneurons after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group. These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate, which is involved in NMDA receptor activation.

Methods: The active ingredients in Citrus aurantium and the targets of Citrus aurantium and NSCLC were collected through the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systematic Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), GeneCards, and OMIM databases. The protein interaction network was constructed using the STRING database, and the component-disease relationship network graph was analyzed using Cytoscape 3.9.1. The Metascape database can be used for GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. The Kaplan-Meier plotter was applied for overall survival analysis of key targets of Citrus aurantium in the treatment of NSCLC. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to determine the mRNA and protein levels of key targets of Citrus aurantium for the treatment of NSCLC. Results: Five active ingredients of Citrus aurantium were screened, and 54 potential targets for the treatment of NSCLC were found, of which the key ingredient was nobiletin and the key targets are TP53, CXCL8, ESR1, PPAR-alpha, and MMP9. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that the mechanism of nobiletin in treating NSCLC may be related to the regulation of cancer signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, lipid and atherosclerosis signaling pathway, and neurodegenerative signaling pathway. The experimental results showed that nobiletin could inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC cells and upregulate the levels of P53 and PPAR-alpha and suppress the expression of MMP9 (P < 0.05).

Dysfunction of calcium homeostasis is established in tissue culture and animal models of ischemia, hypoxia, seizure, trauma, anesthesia, and neurodegenerative diseases. Dantrolene, the primary drug to treat malignant hyperthermia, is a ryanodine receptor antagonist. Dantrolene inhibits abnormal calcium release from the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum, which is the primary intracellular calcium store. Dantrolene has been investigated widely for its possible cytoprotective effects against cell damage in different tissue culture or animal models of diseases involving cytotoxicity induced by disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis in pathogenesis.

In the current study, we hypothesized that host factors, e.g., vitamin D receptor deficiency or adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation, contribute to the enhanced dysbiosis and disrupted barrier in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Using the human CRC database, we found enhanced tumor-invading bacteria and reduced colonic VDR expression, which was correlated with a reduction of Claudin-10 mRNA and protein. In the colon of VDRDeltaIEC mice, deletion of intestinal epithelial VDR led to lower protein of tight junction protein Claudin-10. Lacking VDR and a reduction of Claudin-10 are associated with an increased number of tumors in the mice without myeloid VDR. Intestinal permeability was significantly increased in the mice with myeloid VDR conditional deletion. Further, mice with conditional colonic APC mutation showed reduced mucus layer, enhanced bacteria in tumors, and loss of Claudin-10. Our data from human samples and colon cancer models provided solid evidence- on the host factor regulation of bacterial translocation and dysfunction on barriers in colonic tumorigenesis.

Functional studies indicated TXNRD1 knockdown substantially suppressed HCC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo, and its overexpression showed opposite effects. Mechanistically, TXNRD1 attenuated the interaction between Trx1 and PTEN which resulting in acceleration of PTEN degradation, thereby activated Akt/mTOR signaling and its target genes which conferred to elevated HCC cell mobility and metastasis. Moreover, USF2 was identified as a transcriptional suppressor of TXNRD1, which directly interacted with two E-box sites in TXNRD1 promoter. USF2 functioned as tumor suppressor through the downstream repression of TXNRD1. Further clinical data revealed negative co-expression correlations between USF2 and TXNRD1.

Here, we revealed that LD formation is critical for the adaptation to sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. We aim to investigate the LD function and its regulatory mechanisms in HCC. Methods: The key proteins responsible for LD formation were screened by both metabolomics and proteomics in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells and further validated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining. Biological function of AKR1C3 was evaluated by CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing. Isotopic tracing analysis with deuterium3-labeled palmitate or carbon13-labeled glucose was conducted to investigate fatty acid (FA) and glucose carbon flux. Seahorse analysis was performed to assess the glycolytic flux and mitochondrial function. Selective AKR1C3 inhibitors were used to evaluate the effect of AKR1C3 inhibition on HCC tumor growth and induction of autophagy. Results: We found that long-term sorafenib treatment impairs fatty acid oxidation (FAO), leading to LD accumulation in HCC cells. Using multi-omics analysis in cultured HCC cells, we identified that aldo-keto reductase AKR1C3 is responsible for LD accumulation in HCC. Genetic loss of AKR1C3 fully depletes LD contents, navigating FA flux to phospholipids, sphingolipids, and mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that AKR1C3-dependent LD accumulation is required for mitigating sorafenib-induced mitochondrial lipotoxicity and dysfunction. Pharmacologic inhibition of AKR1C3 activity instantly induces autophagy-dependent LD catabolism, resulting in mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in sorafenib-resistant HCC clones. Notably, manipulation of AKR1C3 expression is sufficient to drive the metabolic switch between FAO and glycolysis. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that AKR1C3-dependent LD formation is critical for the adaptation to sorafenib in HCC through regulating lipid and energy homeostasis. AKR1C3-dependent LD accumulation protects HCC cells from sorafenib-induced mitochondrial lipotoxicity by regulating lipophagy. Targeting AKR1C3 might be a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC tumors.", "pmid": "36451864"}

Little is known regarding the mechanism, although it is assumed that acetaldehyde or estrogen mediated pathways play a role. We previously showed that long-term exposure to 2.5 mM ethanol (blood alcohol ~0.012%) of MCF-12A, a human normal epithelial breast cell line, induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and oncogenic transformation. In this study, we investigated in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, whether a similar exposure to ethanol at concentrations ranging up to peak blood levels in heavy drinkers would increase malignant progression. Short-term (1-week) incubation to ethanol at as low as 1-5 mM (corresponding to blood alcohol concentration of ~0.0048-0.024%) upregulated the stem cell related proteins Oct4 and Nanog, but they were reduced after exposure at 25 mM. Long-term (4-week) exposure to 25 mM ethanol upregulated the Oct4 and Nanog proteins, as well as the malignancy marker Ceacam6. DNA microarray analysis in cells exposed for 1 week showed upregulated expression of metallothionein genes, particularly MT1X. Long-term exposure upregulated expression of some malignancy related genes (STEAP4, SERPINA3, SAMD9, GDF15, KRT15, ITGB6, TP63, and PGR, as well as the CEACAM, interferon related, and HLA gene families). Some of these findings were validated by RT-PCR. A similar treatment also modulated numerous microRNAs (miRs) including one regulator of Oct4 as well as miRs involved in oncogenesis and/or malignancy, with only a few estrogen-induced miRs. Long-term 25 mM ethanol also induced a 5.6-fold upregulation of anchorage-independent growth, an indicator of malignant-like features. Exposure to acetaldehyde resulted in little or no effect comparable to that of ethanol.

Methods: RNA-seq and quantitative real-time PCR were used to determine gene expression changes when ETS1 and HMGA2 was knocked down using short-hairpin RNAs or overexpressed by lentivirus. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry experiments were performed to assess the roles of ETS1 and HMGA2 in LESC proliferation. ETS1-bound cis-regulatory elements and target genes in LESCs were identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. The epigenetic features of ETS1-binding sites were assessed by the published histone modification and chromatin accessibility profiles. Results: ETS1 was robustly expressed in LESCs but dramatically reduced on differentiation into corneal epithelial cells (CECs). ETS1 knockdown in LESCs inhibited cellular proliferation and activated CEC markers (KRT3, KRT12, CLU, and ALDH3A1). When ETS1 was overexpressed during CEC differentiation, LESC-associated genes were upregulated while CEC-associated genes were downregulated. The genome-wide binding profile of ETS1 was identified in LESCs. ETS1 occupied H3K4me3-marked promoters and H3K27ac/H3K4me1-marked enhancers. ETS1-binding sites were also enriched for chromatin accessibility signal. HMGA2 showed a consistent expression pattern with ETS1. ETS1 activates HMAG2 by binding to its promoter. Knockdown and overexpression experiments suggested that HMGA2 can promote LESC proliferation and inhibits its differentiation.

They were allocated in three groups; those with sporadic colon adenocarcinoma (n = 56, 32.9%), those with colonic polyps (n = 33, 19.4%) and healthy controls (n = 81, 47.7%). All patients were evaluated for oxidant activity and antioxidant capacity with serum measurements of specific markers such as vitamins A, 25(OH) D3, E, C, B12, folic acid, glutathione, selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), free iron (Fe2+), and malondialdehyde and results were compared between groups. RESULTS: Serum levels of vitamins C, E, D, Se, Zn, vitamin B12 and total antioxidant capacity were significantly lower in the combined neoplasia/polyp group than in the control group (P = 0.002, P = 0.009, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.020 and P < 0.001, correspondingly). Increased levels of vitamin E (P = 0.004), vitamin D (P < 0.001), Se (P < 0.001) and Zn (P < 0.001) seem to bestow a protective effect on the development of CRC. For vitamin D (P < 0.001) and Zn (P = 0.036), this effect seems to extend to the development of colon polyps as well. On the other hand, elevated serum levels of malondialdehyde are associated with a higher risk of CRC (OR = 2.09 compared to controls, P = 0.004). Regarding colonic polyp development, increased concentrations of vitamin Alpha and Fe2+ are associated with a higher risk, whereas lower levels of malondialdehyde with a lower risk. CONCLUSION: Increased oxidative stress may play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of CRC. Antioxidants' presence may exert a protective effect in the very early stages of colon carcinogenesis.", "pmid": "36438709"}

Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) embedded with 5 wt% nano-ZnO was immersed in distilled water, 50% ethanol, 4% acetic acid, and n-heptane. The cycle of immersion-rinse-dry was repeated up to 40 times for same sample under constant condition. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and UV-Vis spectroscopy analyses were performed to identify the changes in the chemical and functional properties of the nanocomposite film. Acetic acid had the greatest impact on the LDPE-ZnO nanocomposite films, while other food simulants caused little change. A new carboxylate bond was formed by the reaction of ZnO with acetic acid, as evidenced by the FTIR spectra. In addition, XRD and XAS confirmed the phase changes of nano-ZnO into zinc salts such as zinc hydroxy acetate or zinc acetate dihydrate. Furthermore, the light barrier property of the nanocomposite film drastically decreased, owing to the change in the bandgap of ZnO and film morphology.", "pmid": "36616360"}

Here, we report the 5-year update from the COLUMBUS trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01909453). METHODS: Patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600-mutant melanoma, untreated or progressed after first-line immunotherapy, were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg twice daily, vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily, or encorafenib 300 mg once daily. An updated analysis was conducted 65 months after the last patient was randomly assigned. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-seven patients were randomly assigned: 192 to encorafenib plus binimetinib, 191 to vemurafenib, and 194 to encorafenib. The 5-year PFS and OS rates with encorafenib plus binimetinib were 23% and 35% overall and 31% and 45% in those with normal lactate dehydrogenase levels, respectively. In comparison, the 5-year PFS and OS rates with vemurafenib were 10% and 21% overall and 12% and 28% in those with normal lactate dehydrogenase levels, respectively. The median duration of response with encorafenib plus binimetinib was 18.6 months, with disease control achieved in 92.2% of patients. In comparison, the median duration of response with vemurafenib was 12.3 months, with disease control achieved in 81.2% of patients. Long-term follow-up showed no new safety concerns, and results were consistent with the known tolerability profile of encorafenib plus binimetinib. Interactive visualization of the data presented in this article is available at COLUMBUS dashboard.

In the current study, this combinatorial treatment approach was evaluated in a co-clinical trial in patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and safety was established in a clinical trial of binimetinib and palbociclib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with RAS mutations. Across 18 PDX models undergoing dual inhibition of MEK and CDK4/6, 60% of tumors regressed, meeting the co-clinical trial primary endpoint. Prolonged duration of response occurred predominantly in TP53 wild-type models. Clinical evaluation of binimetinib and palbociclib in a safety lead-in confirmed safety and provided preliminary evidence of activity. Prolonged treatment in PDX models resulted in feedback activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and acquired resistance, which was reversed with a SHP2 inhibitor. These results highlight the clinical potential of this combination in colorectal cancer, along with the utility of PDX-based co-clinical trial platforms for drug development.

However, the function and mechanism of NUF2 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remain unclear. Methods: NUF2 expression was detected in EOC tissues and cell lines. The effects of NUF2 downregulation on cell proliferation, migration and invasion in EOC were analyzed by CCK-8 and Transwell assays. Meanwhile, the effect of NUF2 downregulation on tumor growth in vivo was determined by xenograft tumor models. The mechanisms by which NUF2 regulates EOC progression were detected by RNA sequencing and a series of in vitro assays. Results: We showed that NUF2 was significantly upregulated in EOC tissues and cell lines, and high NUF2 expression was associated with FIGO stage, pathological grade and poor EOC prognosis. NUF2 downregulation decreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth in nude mice. RNA sequencing studies showed that NUF2 knockdown inhibited several genes enriched in the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) was the key factor involved in both of the above pathways. We found that ERBB3 silencing could inhibit EOC progression and repress activation of the PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore, the exogenous overexpression of ERBB3 partially reversed the inhibitory effects on EOC progression induced by NUF2 downregulation, while LY294002 and PD98059 partially reversed the effects of ERBB3 upregulation. Conclusion: These results showed that NUF2 promotes EOC progression through ERBB3-induced activation of the PI3K-AKT and MAPK signaling axes. These findings suggest that NUF2 might be a potential therapeutic target for EOC.", "pmid": "36620547"}

However, limited research has been conducted to understand the possible mechanisms that mediate toxicity and pulmonary health effects of e-cigs. We hypothesized that sub-chronic e-cig exposure induces inflammatory response and dysregulated repair/extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which occur through the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRalpha7). Adult wild-type (WT), nAChRalpha7 knockout (KO), and lung epithelial cell-specific KO (nAChRalpha7 CreCC10) mice were exposed to e-cig aerosol containing propylene glycol (PG) with or without nicotine. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and lung tissues were collected to determine e-cig induced inflammatory response and ECM remodeling, respectively. Sub-chronic e-cig exposure with nicotine increased inflammatory cellular influx of macrophages and T-lymphocytes including increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in BALF and increased SARS-Cov-2 Covid-19 ACE2 receptor, whereas nAChRalpha7 KO mice show reduced inflammatory responses associated with decreased ACE2 receptor. Interestingly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP2, MMP8 and MMP9, were altered both at the protein and mRNA transcript levels in female and male KO mice, but WT mice exposed to PG alone showed a sex-dependent phenotype. Moreover, MMP12 was increased significantly in male mice exposed to PG with or without nicotine in a nAChRalpha7-dependent manner. Additionally, sub-chronic e-cig exposure with or without nicotine altered the abundance of ECM proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin, significantly in a sex-dependent manner, but without the direct role of nAChRalpha7 gene. Overall, sub-chronic e-cig exposure with or without nicotine affected lung inflammation and repair responses/ECM remodeling, which were mediated by nAChRalpha7 in a sex-dependent manner.", "pmid": "32552811"}

Unfortunately, the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT-related behaviors; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years, and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances. METHODS: A sample of 997 participants (52 % male) was recruited to four control groups (non-drug (ND), alcohol/nicotine (AN), cannabis/alcohol/nicotine (CAN), non-ecstasy polydrug (PD)), and two ecstasy polydrug groups (present (MDMA) and past users (EX-MDMA). Participants completed a drug history questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised which, in total, provided 13 psychometric measures. RESULTS: While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non-drug controls, the MDMA and EX-MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures. Strikingly, despite prolonged abstinence (mean, 4.98; range, 4-9 years), past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery. Compared with present ecstasy users, the past users showed no change for ten measures, increased impairment for two measures, and improvement on just one measure.

Here, we compared the levels of branched-chain alpha-keto acids (BCKAs) and glutamate/glutamine, which are the byproducts of BCAA catabolism and uric acid among adolescents with obesity prior to and following a 6-month lifestyle-intervention program. METHODS: Fasting plasma samples from 33 adolescents with obesity (16 males, 17 females, aged 12-18 year) were analysed by flow-injection tandem MS and LC-MS/MS. Multiple linear regression models were used to correlate changes in BCKAs, glutamate/glutamine and uric acid with changes in weight and insulin sensitivity as assessed by HOMA-IR, adiponectin and the ratio of triglyceride (TG) to HDL. In predictive models, BCKAs, glutamate/glutamine and uric acid at baseline were used as explanatory variables. RESULTS: Baseline BCKAs, glutamate/glutamine and uric acid were higher in males than females despite comparable BMI-metrics. Following lifestyle-intervention, alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate (alpha-KMV, a metabolic by product of isoleucine) decreased in males but not in females. The ratio of BCKA/BCAA trended lower in males. In the cohort as a whole, BCKAs correlated positively with the ratio of TG to HDL at baseline and HOMA-IR at 6-month-follow-up. Glutamate/glutamine was positively associated with HOMA-IR at baseline and 6-month-follow-up. A reduction in BCKAs was associated with an increase in adiponectin, and those with higher BCKAs at baseline had higher adiponectin levels at 6-month-follow-up. Interestingly those adolescents with higher uric acid levels at baseline had greater reduction in weight. CONCLUSIONS: BCKAs and glutamate/glutamine may serve as biomarkers of IR in adolescents with obesity, and uric acid might serve as a predictor of weight loss in response to lifestyle-intervention. Differential regulation of BCAA catabolism in adolescent males and females implicates critical roles for sex steroids in metabolic homeostasis.", "pmid": "36415168"}

Treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) is the first line of pharmacological intervention in pediatric patients suffering from affect-related illnesses. Although the use of this antidepressant has been deemed efficacious in the juvenile population, the enduring neurobiological consequences of adolescent FLX exposure are not well understood. Therefore, we explored for persistent molecular adaptations, in the adult hippocampus, as a function of adolescent FLX pretreatment. To do this, we administered FLX (20 mg/kg/day) to male C57BL/6 mice during adolescence (postnatal day [PD] 35-49). After a 21-day washout period (PD70), whole hippocampal tissue was dissected. We then used qPCR analysis to assess changes in the expression of genes associated with major intracellular signal transduction pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, and the wingless (Wnt)-dishevelled-GSK3beta signaling cascade. Our results show that FLX treatment results in long-term dysregulation of mRNA levels across numerous genes from the ERK, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt intracellular signaling pathways, along with increases of the transcription factors CREB, DeltaFosB, and Zif268. Lastly, FLX treatment resulted in persistent increases of transcripts associated with cytoskeletal integrity (beta-actin) and caspase activation (DIABLO), while decreasing genes associated with metabolism (fucose kinase) and overall neuronal activation (c-Fos). Collectively, these data indicate that adolescent FLX exposure mediates persistent alterations in hippocampal gene expression in adulthood, thus questioning the safety of early-life exposure to this antidepressant medication.", "pmid": "33241493"}

Folic acid is widely found in fruits and has received more attention for its antioxidant function. However, the role of folic acid in lead-induced kidney injury in rats is unclear. This study was designed to investigate the effects of folic acid on oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the kidney of rats caused by lead exposure. Methods: Forty specific pathogen-free male Rattus norvegicus rats were randomly divided into control, lead, intervention, and folic acid groups. The levels of SOD, GSH-Px, GSH, and MDA were measured by biochemical kits. The protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1, CHOP, and GRP78 were measured by immunofluorescence. Results: This study showed that lead exposure increased the blood levels of lead in mice. However, the intervention of folic acid decreased the levels of lead, but the difference was not statistically significant. Lead exposure causes oxidative stress by decreasing kidney SOD, GSH-Px, and GSH levels and increasing MDA levels. However, folic acid alleviated the oxidative damage caused by lead exposure by increasing the levels of GSH-Px and GSH and decreasing the levels of MDA. Immunofluorescence results showed that folic acid intervention downregulated the upregulation of kidney Nrf2, HO-1, GRP78, and CHOP expression caused by lead exposure. Discussion: Overall, folic acid alleviates kidney oxidative stress induced by lead exposure by regulating Nrf2 and HO-1, while regulating CHOP and GRP78 to mitigate apoptosis caused by excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress.", "pmid": "36458173"}

The prevalent comorbidity between hypertension and severe COVID-19 suggests common genetic factors may affect the outcome of both diseases. As both hypertension and severe COVID-19 demonstrate sex-biased prevalence, common genetic factors between the two diseases may display sex-biased differential associations. By evaluating COVID-19 association signals of 172-candidate hypertension single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from more than 1 million European individuals in two sex-stratified severe COVID-19 genome-wide association studies from UK BioBank with European ancestry, we revealed one functional cis expression quantitative trait locus of SPEG (rs12474050) showing sex-biased association with severe COVID-19 in women. The risk allele rs12474050*T associates with higher blood pressure. In our study, we found it is significantly correlated with lower SPEG expression in muscle-skeletal but with higher expression in both brain cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere. Additionally, nominal significances were detected for the association between rs12474050*T and lower SPEG expression in both heart left ventricle and atrial appendage; among these tissues, the SPEG expression is nominally significantly higher in females than in males. Further analysis revealed SPEG is mainly expressed in cardiomyocytes in heart and is upregulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with significantly higher upregulation of SPEG only observed in female but not in male COVID-19 patients compared to both normal female and male individuals, suggesting upregulation of SPEG is a female-specific protective mechanism against COVID-19 induced heart damage.

Glucocorticoid and anti-cytokine therapies have been frequently administered to treat COVID-19 but have had limited clinical efficacy in severe and critical cases.

We found that the broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory agent inosine downregulated proinflammatory IL-6, upregulated anti-inflammatory IL-10, and ameliorated acute inflammatory lung injury caused by multiple infectious agents. Inosine significantly improved survival in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. It indirectly impeded TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylation by binding stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), inhibited the activation and nuclear translocation of the downstream transcription factors IRF3 and NF-kappaB, and downregulated IL-6 in the sera and lung tissues of mice infected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), H1N1, or SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: Two siblings underwent a complete ophthalmic examination, including dilated fundus examination, fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence imaging, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, electroretinography, and electrooculography. A clinical diagnosis of autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy was established based on ocular examination and multimodal retinal imaging. Subsequently, clinical exome sequencing consisting of a panel of 6670 genes was carried out to confirm the diagnosis and assess genetic alterations in the protein-coding region of the genome of the patients. The identified mutations were tested in the two affected siblings and one of their parents. RESULTS: Two siblings (a 17-year-old female and a 15-year-old male) presented with reduced visual acuity and bilaterally symmetrical subretinal deposits of hyperautofluorescent materials in the posterior pole, which showed staining in the late phase of fluorescein angiogram.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is one tumor for which limited clinical benefit has been observed with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We previously reported the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan suppressed metastasis in preclinical mouse models through blockade of CCL2-CCR2 monocyte recruitment. Here we leverage dogs with spontaneous OS to determine losartan's safety and pharmacokinetics associated with monocyte pharmacodynamic endpoints, and assess its antitumor activity, in combination with the kinase inhibitor toceranib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CCL2 expression, monocyte infiltration, and monocyte recruitment by human and canine OS tumors and cell lines were assessed by gene expression, ELISA, and transwell migration assays. Safety and efficacy of losartan-toceranib therapy were evaluated in 28 dogs with lung metastatic OS. Losartan PK and monocyte PD responses were assessed in three dose cohorts of dogs by chemotaxis, plasma CCL2, and multiplex cytokine assays, and RNA-seq of losartan-treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Human and canine OS cells secrete CCL2 and elicit monocyte migration, which is inhibited by losartan. Losartan PK/PD studies in dogs revealed that a 10-fold-higher dose than typical antihypertensive dosing was required for blockade of monocyte migration. Treatment with high-dose losartan and toceranib was well-tolerated and induced a clinical benefit rate of 50% in dogs with lung metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Losartan inhibits the CCL2-CCR2 axis, and in combination with toceranib, exerts significant biological activity in dogs with metastatic osteosarcoma, supporting evaluation of this drug combination in patients with pediatric osteosarcoma.

Here we report that RIPK1 functions as an important prosurvival mechanism in melanoma cells undergoing pharmacological ER stress induced by tunicamycin (TM) or thapsigargin (TG) through activation of autophagy. While treatment with TM or TG upregulated RIPK1 and triggered autophagy in melanoma cells, knockdown of RIPK1 inhibited autophagy and rendered the cells sensitive to killing by TM or TG, recapitulating the effect of inhibition of autophagy. Consistently, overexpression of RIPK1 enhanced induction of autophagy and conferred resistance of melanoma cells to TM- or TG-induced cell death. Activation of MAPK8/JNK1 or MAPK9/JNK2, which phosphorylated BCL2L11/BIM leading to its dissociation from BECN1/Beclin 1, was involved in TM- or TG-induced, RIPK1-mediated activation of autophagy; whereas, activation of the transcription factor HSF1 (heat shock factor protein 1) downstream of the ERN1/IRE1-XBP1 axis of the unfolded protein response was responsible for the increase in RIPK1 in melanoma cells undergoing pharmacological ER stress. Collectively, these results identify upregulation of RIPK1 as an important resistance mechanism of melanoma cells to TM- or TG-induced ER stress by protecting against cell death through activation of autophagy, and suggest that targeting the autophagy-activating mechanism of RIPK1 may be a useful strategy to enhance sensitivity of melanoma cells to therapeutic agents that induce ER stress.", "pmid": "26018731"}

However, whether multi-omics can provide sufficient information to reveal comprehensive changes in aged non-human primates remains unclear. Here, we explored changes in host-microbe interactions with aging in Chinese rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta lasiota, CRs) using multi-omics analysis. Results showed marked changes in the oral and gut microbiomes between young and aged CRs, including significantly reduced probiotic abundance and increased pathogenic bacterial abundance in aged CRs. Notably, the abundance of Lactobacillus, which can metabolize tryptophan to produce aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands, was decreased in aged CRs. Consistently, metabolomics detected a decrease in the plasma levels of AhR ligands. In addition, free fatty acid, acyl carnitine, heparin, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester levels were increased in aged CRs, which may contribute to abnormal fatty acid metabolism and cardiovascular disease. Transcriptome analysis identified changes in the expression of genes associated with tryptophan metabolism and inflammation. In conclusion, many potential links among different omics were found, suggesting that aged CRs face multiple metabolic problems, immunological disorders, and oral and gut diseases. We determined that tryptophan metabolism is critical for the physiological health of aged CRs. Our findings demonstrate the value of multi-omics analyses in revealing host-microbe interactions in non-human primates and suggest that similar approaches could be applied in evolutionary and ecological research of other species.", "pmid": "36238598"}

To investigate predictive biomarkers for ETH-induced steatosis, we performed lipidomics analysis using plasma and liver samples collected from rats treated orally with ETH at 30 and 100 mg/kg for 14 days. The ETH-treated rats developed hepatic steatosis with Oil Red O staining-positive vacuolation in the centrilobular hepatocytes accompanied by increased hepatic contents of triglycerides (TG) and decreased plasma TG and total cholesterol levels. A multivariate analysis for lipid profiles revealed differences in each of the 35 lipid species in the plasma and liver between the control and the ETH-treated rats. Of those lipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC) (18:0/20:4) decreased dose-dependently in both the plasma and liver. Moreover, serum TG-rich very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels, especially the large particle fraction of VLDL composed of PC containing arachidonic acid (20:4) involved in hepatic secretion of TG, were decreased dose-dependently. In conclusion, the decreased PC (18:0/20:4) in the liver, possibly leading to suppression of hepatic TG secretion, was considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the ETH-induced hepatic steatosis. Therefore, plasma PC (18:0/20:4) levels are proposed as mechanism-related biomarkers for ETH-induced hepatic steatosis.", "pmid": "35315511"}

To date, the physicochemical stability of dezocine-ramosetron admixtures has not been assessed. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical stability of a combination of dezocine and ramosetron in 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline [NS]) injections. Dezocine-ramosetron admixtures were prepared and stored in glass bottles and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags refrigerated at 4 C or stored at ambient temperatures (25 C) for up to 14 days. Initial concentrations were 5.0 mg/100 mL for dezocine and 0.3 mg/100 mL for ramosetron used as the diluents. Stability parameters (drug concentrations and pH values) were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography and pH measurements, respectively. Compatibility (cloudiness, discoloration, and precipitation) was assessed visually. After 14 days at 4  C or 25  C, the concentration losses of dezocine and ramosetron were both < 4%. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in color, turbidity, or pH values were observed in any of the batches.

The acute toxicity of OPs is the result of their irreversible binding with AChEs in the central nervous system (CNS), which elevates acetylcholine (ACh) levels. The protective action of subcutaneously (SC) administered antidotes or their combinations in DFP (2.0 mg/kg BW) intoxication was studied in 9-10-weeks-old Han-Wistar male rats. The rats received AChE reactivator pralidoxime-2-chloride (2PAM) (30.0 mg/kg BW), anticonvulsant diazepam (2.0 mg/kg BW), A(1)-adenosine receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyl adenosine (CPA) (2.0 mg/kg BW), NMDA-receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (+-MK801 hydrogen maleate) (2.0 mg/kg BW) or their combinations with cholinolytic drug atropine sulfate (50.0 mg/kg BW) immediately or 30 min after the single SC injection of DFP. The control rats received atropine sulfate, but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and DFP, respectively. All rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the DFP injection. The rats treated with DFP-atropine showed severe typical OP-induced toxicity signs. When CPA, diazepam or 2PAM was given immediately after DFP-atropine, these treatments prevented, delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning. Atropine-MK801 did not offer any additional protection against DFP toxicity. In conclusion, CPA, diazepam and 2PAM in combination with atropine prevented the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning and thus reduced the toxicity of DFP in rat.", "pmid": "15036754"}

As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that the expression of ganglioside GD1a was significantly reduced in MSCs derived from LmnaDhe/+ mice and in MSCs subjected to Lamin A/C knockdown using siRNA. Osteogenesis-related bone morphogenetic protein-2 and Osteocalcin protein, and gene expression were significantly decreased due to Lmna dysfunction.

The growth factor progranulin plays a critical role in several cancer models, where it regulates tumor initiation and progression. Recent data from our laboratories have demonstrated that progranulin and its receptor, EphA2, constitute an oncogenic pathway in bladder cancer by promoting motility, invasion and in vivo tumor formation. Progranulin and EphA2 are expressed in mesothelioma cells but their mechanisms of action are not well defined. In addition, there are no data establishing whether the progranulin/EphA2 axis is tumorigenic for mesothelioma cells. METHODS: The expression of progranulin in various mesothelioma cell lines derived from all major mesothelioma subtypes was examined by western blots on cell lysates, conditioned media and ELISA assays. The biological roles of progranulin, EphA2, EGFR, RYK and FAK were assessed in vitro by immunoblots, human phospho-RTK antibody arrays, pharmacological (specific inhibitors) and genetic (siRNAs, shRNAs, CRISPR/Cas9) approaches, motility, invasion and adhesion assays. In vivo tumorigenesis was determined by xenograft models. Focal adhesion turnover was evaluated biochemically using focal adhesion assembly/disassembly assays and immunofluorescence analysis with focal adhesion-specific markers. RESULTS: In the present study we show that progranulin is upregulated in various mesothelioma cell lines covering all mesothelioma subtypes and is an important regulator of motility, invasion, adhesion and in vivo tumor formation. However, our results indicate that EphA2 is not the major functional receptor for progranulin in mesothelioma cells, where progranulin activates a complex signaling network including EGFR and RYK. We further characterized progranulin mechanisms of action and demonstrated that progranulin, by modulating FAK activity, regulates the kinetic of focal adhesion disassembly, a critical step for cell motility. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results highlight the complexity of progranulin oncogenic signaling in mesothelioma, where progranulin modulate functional cross-talks between multiple RTKs, thereby suggesting the need for combinatorial therapeutic approaches to improve treatments of this aggressive disease.", "pmid": "36471440"}

The antitumour role of propofol, a widely used intravenous sedative-hypnotic agent, has been recently reported in different cancer types. In this study, we aimed to assess the role of propofol on osteosarcoma and explore the possible mechanisms. Propofol of increasing concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mug/ml) was used to treat the MG63 and 143B cells for 72 hours, and the CCK8 assay was applied to evaluate the tumour cell proliferation. Tumour cell migration and invasion were assessed with the transwell assay. The tumour cells were also treated with doxorubicin single agent or in combination with propofol to explore their synergic role. Differential expressed genes after propofol treatment were obtained and functionally assessed with bioinformatic tools. Expression of ER stress markers CHOP, p-eIF2alpha, and XBP1s was evaluated to validate the activation of ER stress response with western blot and qRT-PCR. The statistical analyses were performed with R v4.2.1. Propofol treatment led to significant growth inhibition in MG63 and 143B cells in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Osteosarcoma migration (MG63 91.4 (82-102) vs. 56.8 (49-65), p < 0.05; 143B 96.6 (77-104) vs. 45.4 (28-54), p < 0.05) and invasion (MG63 68.6 (61-80) vs. 32 (25-39), p < 0.05; 143B 90.6 (72-100) vs. 39.2 (26-55), p < 0.05) were reduced after propofol treatment.

The gut microbiota is highly correlated with androgen secretion and insulin resistance (IR), which are two potential major pathogenic mechanisms of PCOS. Currently, an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) is often used to construct pseudo germ-free mouse models for studies on the gut microbiota and PCOS. Our work aimed to study the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a high-fat diet (HFD) and ABX on the heterogeneous phenotypes of PCOS mouse models by regulating the gut microbiota. Methods: PCOS mouse models were established by subcutaneous injection of DHEA alone or in combination with a HFD in wild-type and pseudo germ-free mice. The changes in ovary morphology and sex hormonal and glycolipid metabolic parameters were evaluated. Results: Wild-type mice treated with DHEA or DHEA+HFD showed a PCOS-like phenotype of hyperandrogenism, anovulation and polycystic ovaries. The former was combined with hyperinsulinemia and IR, while the latter was combined with glucolipid metabolic disorders, extremely heterogeneous hyperinsulinemia and IR. The phenotype of PCOS mice, especially the metabolic parameters, was correlated with the gut microbiota. The pseudo germ-free mice treated with DHEA or DHEA+HFD also showed a PCOS-like phenotype. However, DHEA could not induce hyperinsulinemia or IR in pseudo germ-free mice. Pseudo germ-free mice treated with DHEA+HFD exhibited decreased serum AMH level, glucolipid metabolic disorders and IR. Compared with the wild-type mice, the pseudo germ-free mice treated with DHEA showed significantly higher testosterone and lipid levels and lower blood glucose levels, and they did not present with hyperinsulinemia or IR. Conclusion: A better and stabilized mouse model simulating the pathophysiological defects of PCOS was induced by DHEA alone rather than by DHEA+HFD. The ABX intervention improved glucose metabolic disorders and hyperinsulinemia but aggravated the hyperandrogenism and lipid metabolic disorders of the PCOS mice. This study suggests that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the heterogeneous phenotypes of PCOS mouse models.", "pmid": "36619569"}

Likewise, patients with genetic iron overload diseases develop diabetes, suggesting a tight link between iron metabolism and diabetes. The liver controls systemic iron homeostasis and is a central organ for T2DM. Here, we investigate how the control of iron metabolism in hepatocytes is affected by T2DM. METHODS: Perls Prussian blue staining was applied to analyze iron distribution in liver biopsies of T2DM patients. To identify molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocyte iron accumulation we established cellular models of insulin resistance by treatment with palmitate and insulin. RESULTS: We show that a subset of T2DM patients accumulates iron in hepatocytes, a finding mirrored in a hepatocyte model of insulin resistance. Iron accumulation can be explained by the repression of the iron exporter ferroportin upon palmitate and/or insulin treatment. While during palmitate treatment the activation of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin may contribute to reducing ferroportin protein levels in a cell-autonomous manner, insulin treatment decreases ferroportin transcription via the PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: Repression of ferroportin at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level may contribute to iron accumulation in hepatocytes observed in a subset of patients with T2DM.", "pmid": "36436807"}

This study aimed to explore the role of PSD95 in (Ang-(1-7))-Mas-mediated cerebral ischaemia protection and its regulatory mechanism. METHODS: Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) neuron and rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models were used as in vitro and in vivo models, respectively. TAT-MAS9C was used to disrupt the interaction between PSD95 and Mas. The recombinant PSD95 adenovirus (Ad-PSD95) was used to overexpress PSD95 in neurons. RESULTS: Results showed that in OGD neurons, Ang-(1-7) could promote cell viability; reduce cell apoptosis; reduce the cell membrane localisation of Mas; upregulate the expression levels of pAKT, bcl-2 and I-kappaB; and downregulate the expression levels of Bax, pI-kappaB, tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta. TAT-MAS9C could enhance the aforementioned effects of Ang-(1-7). However, the PSD95 overexpression inhibited the aforementioned effects of Ang-(1-7). In the MCAO rat model, the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed that Ang-(1-7) reduced the infarct volume. The Morris water maze test showed that the number of crossings over the platform area in the Ang-(1-7) group was significantly increased. TAT-MAS9C could promote the protective effect of Ang-(1-7).

Orphenadrine is mainly used in combination with diclofenac for musculoskeletal injuries and postoperative pain control. The objective of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of diclofenac-orphenadrine, diclofenac alone and saline. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center clinical study investigating the opioid-sparing effect of a combination of diclofenac and orphenadrine versus diclofenac alone versus isotonic saline solution. Initially 72 patients were included and received total intravenous anesthesia during cruciate ligament surgery. All patients were postoperatively treated with a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device containing hydromorphone. Pharmacological safety was assessed by laboratory parameters, vital signs, and delirium detection scores. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in cumulative dose of PCA analgesics required after 24 h postsurgery, with 5.90 mg (SD +- 2.90 mg) in the placebo group, 5.73 mg (SD +- 4.75 mg) in the diclofenac group, and 4.13 mg (SD +- 2.57 mg) in the diclofenac-orphenadrine group. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the groups in cumulative dose of PCA analgesics required 2 h postsurgery (n = 65). Mean dose of hydromorphone required after 2 h was 1.54 mg (SD +- 0.57 mg) in the placebo group, 1.56 mg (SD +- 1.19 mg) in the diclofenac-only group, and 1.37 mg (SD +- 0.78 mg) in the diclofenac-orphenadrine group.

Here, we explored the genetic landscape of RBFOX1 more deeply, integrating evidence from existing and new human studies as well as studies in Rbfox1 knockout mice. Mining existing data from large-scale studies of human common genetic variants, we confirmed gene-based and genome-wide association of RBFOX1 with risk tolerance, major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Data on six mental disorders revealed copy number losses and gains to be more frequent in ASD cases than in controls. Consistently, RBFOX1 expression appeared decreased in post-mortem frontal and temporal cortices of individuals with ASD and prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia. Brain-functional MRI studies demonstrated that carriers of a common RBFOX1 variant, rs6500744, displayed increased neural reactivity to emotional stimuli, reduced prefrontal processing during cognitive control, and enhanced fear expression after fear conditioning, going along with increased avoidance behaviour. Investigating Rbfox1 neuron-specific knockout mice allowed us to further specify the role of this gene in behaviour. The model was characterised by pronounced hyperactivity, stereotyped behaviour, impairments in fear acquisition and extinction, reduced social interest, and lack of aggression; it provides excellent construct and face validity as an animal model of ASD. In conclusion, convergent translational evidence shows that common variants in RBFOX1 are associated with a broad spectrum of psychiatric traits and disorders, while rare genetic variation seems to expose to early-onset neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders with and without developmental delay like ASD, in particular. Studying the pleiotropic nature of RBFOX1 can profoundly enhance our understanding of mental disorder vulnerability.", "pmid": "35948661"}

However, choriocarcinomas have not been profiled for endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2) expression. ERAP2 trims peptides presented by human leukocyte antigens (HLA) that have shown to modulate immune response. Over 50% of choriocarcinomas we screened lack ERAP2 expression, which suggests that the absence of ERAP2 expression allows immune evasion of choriocarcinoma cells. We demonstrate that the ability of choriocarcinoma cells to activate lymphocytes was lowest with cells lacking ERAP2 (JEG-3) or HLA-C (JAr). This observation suggests that activation is dependent on expression of both ERAP2 and HLA-C molecules. In addition, an ERAP2 variant in which lysine is changed to asparagine (K392N) results in increased trimming activity (165-fold) for hydrophobic peptides and biologically never been detected. We hypothesize that homozygosity for the N392 ERAP2 variant is prohibited because it modulates the immune recognition of placental trophoblasts. We demonstrate that NK-cell activation and killing were significantly dependent on forced expression of the N392 ERAP2 isoform in JEG-3 cells.

RESULTS: In A549/DDP cells, miR-125b-5p expression was upregulated compared to A549 cells. Then miR-125b-5p was found to increase DDP resistance in NSCLC in vivo and in vitro by increasing cell proliferation and suppressing cell apoptosis. Bioinformatic analyses were used to search for gene which miR-125b-5p can target. We identified miR-125b-5p can regulate CREB1 via luciferase reporter assays, qRT-PCR and western blots. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were also performed to confirm miR-125b-5p could impact on CREB1 and induce the DDP resistance in NSCLC.

However, the pathogenesis of SFTS virus (SFTSV) in humans remains unclear. Also, there are no effective therapeutics for SFTS. Cyclophilin A (CyPA) regulates protein folding and trafficking involved in various viral infectious diseases, but its role in SFTSV infection has not been elucidated. Methods: We detected plasma CyPA levels in 29 healthy subjects and 30 SFTS patients by ELISA. In THP-1 cells and normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), SFTSV-induced extracellular CyPA (eCyPA) was also detected by ELISA. In THP-1, the effects of CyPA on Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and NF-kappaB were determined by Western blot. We validated the interaction between CypA and CD147 by human recombinant CyPA (hrCyPA) and the CD147 inhibitor. Effects of CyPA inhibitor Cyclosporine A (CsA) on cytokines and SFTSV replication in THP-1 cells was also detected. 8-week-old Interferon-alpha/beta Receptor (IFNAR) knockout (IFNAR-/-) C57BL/6 mice were divided into mock group, 106TCID50 SFTSV (Untreated) group and 106TCID50 SFTSV+CsA (CsA-treated) group. The changes of body weight, animal behavior and survival time of each group were recorded. Blood samples were collected from tail vein regularly. After death, the liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain were collected for pathological HE staining and SFTSV-NP immunohistochemical staining. Results: Compared to healthy subjects and SFTS patients in the febrile phase of the disease, plasma CyPA levels in SFTS patients at the multi-organ dysfunction (MOD) phase showed significantly elevated (P < 0.01). Extracellular CyPA activates the MAPK pathway by binding to CD147 in THP-1 infected with SFTSV.

The study aimed to examine the effect of tIRI-activated NADPH oxidase (NOX) on the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway components. Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 12 each) were studied: sham, unilateral tIRI only and tIRI treated with apocynin, a NOX-specific inhibitor. The tIRI rat model was subjected to 1 h of ischemia followed by 4 h of reperfusion. H&E staining, real time PCR, biochemical assays, and Western blot were utilized to evaluate spermatogenic damage, gene expression, oxidative stress markers, and NLRP3 pathway components, respectively. As a result of tIRI, decreased total antioxidant capacity and suppressed activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were associated with spermatogenic arrest. The components of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway (TXNIP, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, GSDMD, MMP-9) were upregulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally during tIRI. In parallel, tissue inflammation was demonstrated by a marked increase in the concentrations of myeloperoxidase, IL-1beta, and IL-18. Apocynin treatment prevented testicular oxidative stress and inflammation. Thus, NOX inhibition by apocynin prevented ROS accumulation, proinflammatory cytokine overexpression and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during tIRI.", "pmid": "36671008"}

Although associations between grey matter and dependence on stimulants have been frequently reported, white matter correlates have received less attention. METHODS: Eleven international sites ascribed to the ENIGMA-Addiction consortium contributed data from individuals with dependence on cocaine (n = 147), methamphetamine (n = 132) and nicotine (n = 189), as well as non-dependent controls (n = 333). We compared the fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) and mean diffusivity (MD) of 20 bilateral tracts. Also, we compared the performance of various machine learning algorithms in deriving brain-based classifications on stimulant dependence. RESULTS: The cocaine and methamphetamine groups had lower regional FA and higher RD in several association, commissural, and projection white matter tracts. The methamphetamine dependent group additionally showed lower regional AD. The nicotine group had lower FA and higher RD limited to the anterior limb of the internal capsule. The best performing machine learning algorithm was the support vector machine (SVM). The SVM successfully classified individuals with dependence on cocaine (AUC = 0.70, p < 0.001) and methamphetamine (AUC = 0.71, p < 0.001) relative to non-dependent controls. Classifications related to nicotine dependence proved modest (AUC = 0.62, p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Stimulant dependence was related to FA disturbances within tracts consistent with a role in addiction. The multivariate pattern of white matter differences proved sufficient to identify individuals with stimulant dependence, particularly for cocaine and methamphetamine.", "pmid": "34861493"}

Elderly patients are the high-risk population for aortic dissection (AD). Young patients with AD usually have heritable connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. However, young AD patients without heritable connective tissue disease are relatively rare. Case presentation: Herein, we report a case of a 25-year-old female diagnosed with ATAAD accompanied by undeveloped secondary sexual characteristics. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed that her AD involved the ascending and abdominal aorta. She had undergone thoracic endovascular aortic stent graft implantation in a local hospital due to acute Stanford type B aortic dissection at age 19. No uterus or ovaries were found on CTA and transabdominal ultrasonography. Sex hormone detection revealed a low estrogen level. G-banded karyotyping analyses revealed a normal 46,XX karyotype. Finally, her abnormalities in the reproductive system were diagnosed as MRKH syndrome and 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) in the patient found an SNP variant of ACTA2 c.773G>A and MYH11 c.5081A>G. MYH11 c.5081A>G was also found in her mother and younger brother. Copy number variations sequencing (CNV-seq) found an approximately 109.30 Kb duplication at chromosome 6p22.3 (Chr 6: g.24920238-25029535) with a copy number of 3. We performed emergent total aortic arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk surgery, and the patient recovered well after surgery.

Most ARVC mutations interfere with beta-catenin-dependent transcription that enhances adipogenesis; however, the mechanistic pathway to arrhythmogenesis is not clear. We hypothesized that adipogenic conditions play an important role in the formation of arrhythmia substrates in ARVC. Cardiac myocyte monolayers co-cultured for 2-4 days with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells with the ARVC5 TMEM43 p.Ser358Leu mutation. The TMEM43 mutation in myocyte co-cultures alone had no significant effect on impulse conduction velocity (CV) or APD. In contrast, when co-cultures were exposed to pro-adipogenic factors for 2-4 days, CV and APD were significantly reduced compared to controls by 49% and 31%, respectively without evidence of adipogenesis. Additionally, these arrhythmia substrates coincided with a significant reduction in IGF-1 expression in MSCs and were mitigated by IGF-1 treatment. These findings suggest that the onset of enhanced adipogenic signaling may be a mechanism of early arrhythmogenesis, which could lead to personalized treatment for arrhythmias associated with TMEM43 and other ARVC mutations.", "pmid": "36294819"}

Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4-positive (CTLA-4+) regulatory T cells (Treg) dampen cellular immunity and correlate negatively with clinical outcomes. This phase I study added ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 mAb, to cetuximab-radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A (3 + 3) design was used to establish the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ipilimumab, added at week 5 for four, every-3-week doses to fixed, standard cetuximab-radiotherapy. Eligible subjects had stage III to IVb, high-risk [human papillomavirus-negative (HPV-)] or intermediate-risk HPV-positive (HPV+)] HNSCC. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any grade 4 adverse event (AE) except in-field radiation dermatitis or immune-related (ir) AE requiring >=2 weeks of systemic steroids. Baseline tumor and serial blood specimens were collected for immune correlatives. RESULTS: From July 2013 to May 2016, 18 patients enrolled. Two of 6 in cohort 1 (ipilimumab 3 mg/kg) experienced grade 3 dermatologic DLTs, triggering deescalation of ipilimumab to 1 mg/kg. Dose level -1 was expanded to N  =  12 without DLT. irAE included: grade 1, 2, and 3 dermatitis (2, 1, and 3 cases), grade 4 colitis (1), and grade 1 hyperthyroidism (1). Three-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival were 72% [90% confidence interval (CI), 57-92] and 72% (90% CI, 56-92). High expression of coinhibitory receptors PD1/LAG3/CD39 on baseline tumor-infiltrating Treg was associated with worse DFS (HR = 5.6; 95% CI, 0.83-37.8; P = 0.08).

Using viral vectors to deliver the cargo for inactivating the PD-L1 gene could be associated with host cell genotoxicity and concomitant immune attack. To develop an alternative safe gene delivery method, we designed a unique combination for miRNA34a delivery using a transgene carrier in the form of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (IONPs) via magnetofection to downregulate PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. We synthesized IONPs of multiple shapes (IONRs (iron oxide nanorods), IONSs (iron oxide nanospheres), and ITOHs (iron oxide truncated octahedrons)), surface-functionalized with polyethyleneimine (PEI) using the ligand exchange method, as gene delivery systems. Under the guidance of an external magnetic field, PEI@IONPs loaded with plasmid DNA (DNA/PEI@IONPs) encoding GFP showed high transfection efficiency at different weight ratios and time points in A549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, the DNA/PEI@IONPs with miRNA34a inserts under a static magnetic field resulted in significant knockdown of the PD-L1 gene, as demonstrated via immunoblotting of the PD-L1 protein. Among the three shapes of IONPs, IONRs showed the highest PD-L1 knockdown efficiency. The genetic expression of miRNA34a was also studied using qPCR and it showed high expression of miRNA in cells treated with PEI@IONRs. Flow cytometry and a live/dead assay confirmed apoptosis after transfection with miRNA34a.

Aberrant DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes and subsequent gene expression changes have shown to be involved in the initiation and progression of various malignancies including thyroid malignancies. In this review, we investigated what is known about the impact of promoter hypermethylation on the key tumor suppressor genes known to be involved in cell growth and/or apoptosis of thyroid cancer. Methods: The most important databases were searched for research articles until June 2020 to identify reported tumor suppressor genes that are modulated by methylation modulation changes in thyroid carcinoma. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 26 studies were reviewed using the full text to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: The tumor suppressor genes reviewed here are suggestive biomarkers and potential targetable drugs. Inactivation of RASSF1A, DAPK1, SLCFA8, and TSHR through aberrant epigenetic methylation could activate BRAF/MEK/ERK kinase pathways with potential clinical implications in thyroid cancer patients. RARbeta2 and RUNX3 could suppress cell cycle and induce apoptosis in malignant cells. TIMP3 and PTEN could prevent angiogenesis and invasion through PIP3 pathway and arrest VEFG activity.

Evidence confirms that serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in the T2DM stage are proposed as prognostic markers for DN development, but it is unclear how they affect renal podocyte-associated nephrin and WT-1 expression. In the presence of podocyte injury, glomerular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and hemodynamic parameters are dysregulated. The current research aimed to clarify the relationship of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta with podocyte injury by altering VEGF/eNOS expression and hemodynamic parameters. Methods: A high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced DN rat model was established. Serum TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels were tracked in the pre-T2DM, T2DM and DN stages. In the DN stage, the mRNA and protein expression levels of renal TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, VEGF, eNOS, nephrin and WT-1 were studied. Renal hemodynamic parameters, including peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic flow velocity and mean velocity were measured with a color Doppler ultrasound technique. Results: Compared to those in the normal control (CTL) group, serum TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels increased significantly in the pre-T2DM stage (obesity, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia), T2DM stage (hyperglycemia) and DN stage (abnormal renal functions) (all: P < 0.05) in the DN group. Serum TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in the T2DM stage were significantly higher than those in the pre-T2DM stage (two: P < 0.05). Compared to the CTL group, renal nephrin, WT-1, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, eNOS and VEGF expression and hemodynamic parameters in the DN stage all showed significant differences separately (all: P < 0.05). Conclusion: Increased serum and renal TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels played important roles in reducing renal nephrin and WT-1 expression levels, which may be related to the fact that the former affected renal VEGF/eNOS expression and blood flow parameters in the DN rats.", "pmid": "36532651"}

This study investigated the role of IL-4 and IL-13 in KC responses to changes in extracellular calcium (Ca2+) and analyzed differentiation signals elicited via a Ca2+ sensor, SMOC1. Real-time dynamics of transmembrane Ca2+ influx were assessed in live KCs by flow cytometry and microscopy. Exposure of KCs to a high Ca2+ environment (1.3 mM) triggered a rapid intracellular Ca2+ influx, whereas IL-4- and IL-13-treated cells exhibited a significant decrease in the peak amplitude of Ca2+ influx (P < 0.01). IL-17A and IL-22 did not elicit such responses. Evaluation of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics by microscopy confirmed these observations and revealed heterogeneity of individual KC responses. IL-4 and IL-13 significantly inhibited the expression of Ca2+-binding protein SMOC1 (P < 0.001). Inhibition of epidermal differentiation markers were also observed in SMOC1 small interfering RNA-transfected KCs. Concurrently, the deletion of SMOC1 increased the amplitude of Ca2+ peak response (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our results provide innovative data that IL-4 and IL-13 regulate KC sensitivity to microenvironmental Ca2+ changes and inhibit Ca2+-induced KC differentiation signals.

Both Mlh1 and Pms1 contain a long unstructured linker that connects the N- and carboxyl-terminal domains. Here, we demonstrated the Mlh1 linker contains a conserved motif (Saccharomyces cerevisiae residues 391-415) required for MMR. The Mlh1-R401A,D403A-Pms1 linker motif mutant protein was defective for MMR and endonuclease activity in vitro, even though the conserved motif could be >750 A from the carboxyl-terminal endonuclease active site or the N-terminal adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site. Peptides encoding this motif inhibited wild-type Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease activity. The motif functioned in vivo at different sites within the Mlh1 linker and within the Pms1 linker. Motif mutations in human cancers caused a loss-of-function phenotype when modeled in S. cerevisiae.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that COX-2 activity attenuates fibrosis and preserves microvasculature in injured kidney. The murine unilateral ureteral-obstruction (UUO) model of kidney fibrosis was employed and compared with human nephrectomy tissue with and without chronic hydronephrosis. METHODS: Fibrosis and angiogenic markers were quantified in kidney tissue from wild-type and COX-2-/- mice subjected to UUO for 7 days and in human kidney tissue. COX-enzymes, prostaglandin (PG) synthases, PG receptors, PGE2 , and thromboxane were determined in human tissue. RESULTS: COX-2 immunosignal was observed in interstitial fibroblasts at baseline and after UUO. Fibronectin, collagen I, III, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and fibroblast specific protein-1 mRNAs increased significantly more after UUO in COX-2-/- vs wild-type mice. In vitro, fibroblasts from COX-2-/- kidneys showed higher matrix synthesis. Compared to control, human hydronephrotic kidneys showed (i) fibrosis, (ii) no significant changes in COX-2, COX-1, PGE2 -, and prostacyclin synthases, and prostacyclin and thromboxane receptor mRNAs, (iii) increased mRNA and protein of PGE2 -EP2 receptor level but unchanged PGE2 tissue concentration, and (iv) two- to threefold increased thromboxane synthase mRNA and protein levels, and increased thromboxane B2 tissue concentration in cortex and outer medulla.

As with photostability experiments, biological tests also found remarkable differences in the properties and behavior of thiophene and maltol hybrids. While resveratrol-thiophene hybrids have excellent inhibitory and antioxidant properties (similar to the activity of reference drug galantamine), maltols have been proven to be weaker inhibitors and antioxidants. The molecular docking of selected active ligands gave insight into the structures of docked enzymes. It enabled the identification of interactions between the ligand and the active site of both cholinesterases. The maltols that proved to be active cholinesterase inhibitors were able to coordinate Fe3+ ion, forming complexes of 1:1 composition. Their formation constants, determined by spectrophotometry, are very similar, lgK = 11.6-12.6, suggesting that Fe3+ binds to the common hydroxy-pyranone moiety and is hardly affected by the other aromatic part of the ligand. Accordingly, the characteristic bands in their individual absorption spectra are uniformly red-shifted relative to those of the free ligands. The crystal structures of two new resveratrol-maltol hybrids were recorded, giving additional information on the molecules' intermolecular hydrogen bonds and packing. In this way, several functionalities of these new resveratrol hybrids were examined as a necessary approach to finding more effective drugs for complicated neurodegenerative diseases.", "pmid": "36234916"}
{"abstract_id": "766", "title": "Hydroxychloroquine synergizes with the PI3K inhibitor BKM120 to exhibit antitumor efficacy independent of autophagy.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The critical role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation in tumor cell biology has prompted massive efforts to develop PI3K inhibitors (PI3Kis) for cancer therapy. However, recent results from clinical trials have shown only a modest therapeutic efficacy of single-agent PI3Kis in solid tumors. Targeting autophagy has controversial context-dependent effects in cancer treatment. As a FDA-approved lysosomotropic agent, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been well tested as an autophagy inhibitor in preclinical models. Here, we elucidated the novel mechanism of HCQ alone or in combination with PI3Ki BKM120 in the treatment of cancer. METHODS: The antitumor effects of HCQ and BKM120 on three different types of tumor cells were assessed by in vitro PrestoBlue assay, colony formation assay and in vivo zebrafish and nude mouse xenograft models. The involved molecular mechanisms were investigated by MDC staining, LC3 puncta formation assay, immunofluorescent assay, flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis and ROS, qRT-PCR, Western blot, comet assay, homologous recombination (HR) assay and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: HCQ significantly sensitized cancer cells to BKM120 in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the sensitization mediated by HCQ could not be phenocopied by treatment with other autophagy inhibitors (Spautin-1, 3-MA and bafilomycin A1) or knockdown of the essential autophagy genes Atg5/Atg7, suggesting that the sensitizing effect might be mediated independent of autophagy status. Mechanistically, HCQ induced ROS production and activated the transcription factor NRF2. In contrast, BKM120 prevented the elimination of ROS by inactivation of NRF2, leading to accumulation of DNA damage. In addition, HCQ activated ATM to enhance HR repair, a high-fidelity repair for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in cells, while BKM120 inhibited HR repair by blocking the phosphorylation of ATM and the expression of BRCA1/2 and Rad51. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that HCQ and BKM120 synergistically increased DSBs in tumor cells and therefore augmented apoptosis, resulting in enhanced antitumor efficacy. Our findings provide a new insight into how HCQ exhibits antitumor efficacy and synergizes with PI3Ki BKM120, and warn that one should consider the \"off target\" effects of HCQ when used as autophagy inhibitor in the clinical treatment of cancer.", "pmid": "34844627"}

In this study, we found that AST ameliorated cognitive dysfunction, reduced hippocampal neuronal damage and loss, and Abeta pathology in APP/PS1 mice. Subsequently, AST activated autophagy and up-regulated the levels of autophagic flux-related protein in APP/PS1 mice and Abeta25-35-induced injury in HT22 cells. Interestingly, AST down-regulated the phosphorylation level of PI3K/Akt-mTOR pathway-related proteins, which was reversed by autophagy inhibitors 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) or Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1). At the same time, consistent with the impacts of Akt inhibitor MK2206 and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, inhibited levels of autophagy in Abeta25-35-injured HT22 cells were activated by the administration of AST.

In addition, the pi value, genotype frequency, and dual-luciferase results identified SNP rs312715211 in the intron region of ZNF652 as the key variant. The wild genotype was associated with lower AFP and abdominal fat weight (AFW), but higher body weight (BW). Finally, annotated genes based on the top 1% SNPs were used to investigate the physiological function of ZNF652. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis suggested that ZNF652 may reduce AFW and BW in broilers through the TGF-beta1/SMad2/3 and MAPK/FoxO pathways via EGFR and TGFB1. Our findings elucidated the genetic basis of chicken AFP, rs312715211 on the ZNF652 gene, which can affect BW and AFW and was the key variant associated with AFP. These data provide new insight into the genetic mechanism underlying AF deposition in chickens and could be beneficial in breeding chickens for AF.", "pmid": "36552358"}

Novel combinations may increase efficacy. In addition to demethylating CpG island gene promoter regions, DNMTis enhance PARP1 recruitment and tight binding to chromatin, preventing PARP-mediated DNA repair, downregulating homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, and sensitizing cells to PARP inhibitor (PARPi). We previously demonstrated DNMTi and PARPi combination efficacy in AML in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report a phase I clinical trial combining the DNMTi decitabine and the PARPi talazoparib in relapsed/refractory AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Decitabine and talazoparib doses were escalated using a 3 + 3 design. Pharmacodynamic studies were performed on cycle 1 days 1 (pretreatment), 5 and 8 blood blasts. RESULTS: Doses were escalated in seven cohorts [25 patients, including 22 previously treated with DNMTi(s)] to a recommended phase II dose combination of decitabine 20 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 or 10 days and talazoparib 1 mg orally daily for 28 days, in 28-day cycles. Grade 3-5 events included fever in 19 patients and lung infections in 15, attributed to AML. Responses included complete remission with incomplete count recovery in two patients (8%) and hematologic improvement in three. Pharmacodynamic studies showed the expected DNA demethylation, increased PARP trapping in chromatin, increased gammaH2AX foci, and decreased HR activity in responders. gammaH2AX foci increased significantly with increasing talazoparib doses combined with 20 mg/m2 decitabine. CONCLUSIONS: Decitabine/talazoparib combination was well tolerated. Expected pharmacodynamic effects occurred, especially in responders.", "pmid": "35091444"}

TLR10 was recently identified and very limited data are available on its expression, mechanisms that regulate its expression, and its role in primary immune cells. To study the expression pattern of TLR10 in primary immune cells, we examined TLR10 protein expression in naive and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human neutrophils. Human neutrophils challenged with LPS showed a decrease in total and surface TLR10 expression at 90 min. TLR10 in LPS-activated neutrophils colocalized with flotallin-1, a lipid raft marker, and EEA-1, an early endosomal marker, to suggest its endocytosis. There was increased colocalization of TLR10 with TLR4 at LPS 60 min followed by decrease at later LPS treatment times. Treatment with TLR4 neutralizing antibody decreased cytoplasmic localization of TLR10 in LPS-treated neutrophils. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) depletion and neutralization of p65 subunit of NF-kappaB in LPS-treated neutrophils decreased TLR10 expression. Live cell imaging of LPS-activated neutrophils showed TLR10 translocation in the leading edge and TLR10 knockdown in neutrophils reduced their fMLP-induced chemotaxis and the number of neutrophils with pseudopodia but without affecting the expression of key proteins of actin nucleation process, ARP-3 and Diap1. Taken together, our findings show that neutrophil activation alters TLR10 expression through ROS production and NF-kappaB regulation, and TLR10 knockdown reduced neutrophil chemotaxis.", "pmid": "35613551"}

To investigate how GAP43 expression (GAP43-ir) correlates with MFS, we assessed the intensity (densitometry) and extension (width) of GAP43-ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (IML) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine (Pilo), previously injected or not with cycloheximide (CHX), which has been shown to inhibit MFS. METHODS: CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats. The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs, except for CHX. Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later, and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43-ir in the IML between Pilo, CHX+Pilo, and control groups. However, the results of the width of the GAP43-ir band in the IML showed that CHX+Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band (p = 0.03) as compared with that in the Pilo group. CONCLUSIONS: Our current finding that animals in the CHX+Pilo group have a GAP43-ir band in the IML, similar to that of controls, reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals. The change in GAP43-ir present in Pilo-treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP-43.", "pmid": "15987266"}

This study attempted to screen and validates the biomarkers in the progression of MM via excavating Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Identification of a biomarker may help not only facilitate early diagnosis and management but also identify individuals at risk for poor prognosis and development of MM. Methods: The mRNA expression profile of the GSE87900 dataset was analyzed by GEO2R. Using the SangerBox online program, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in high-risk MM samples were screened with the filter criteria of P<0.05 and  logFC  >1. The SangerBox online analysis tool was used to analyze the volcano plot. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed for DEGs. Twenty patients with high-risk MM and 20 patients with standard-risk MM from Taian City Central Hospital were included. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to verify the selected key genes in MM tissues. Results: A total of 611 DEGs were obtained. GO functional enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in the DNA replication process at the biological level, and the top DEGs were CACYBP, PCNA, MCM6, SMC1A, DTL, GINS4, MCM2, CDT1, RRM2, BRCA1, RFC5, MCM4, GINS3, GINS1, MCM10, CDC7, CDAN1, BRIP1, GINS2, CDK1, NFIB, and BARD1. The expression of CDC7 and PCNA was significantly different in high-risk MM and standard-risk MM as determined by RT-qPCR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the areas under the curve predicted by CDC7 and PCNA were 0.900 and 0.8863, respectively, which allowed the identification of CDC7 and PCNA could be a potential biomarker of MM. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that MM patients with high CDC7 and PCNA expression had shorter 2-year overall survival (OS) (P<0.05).

Current theories suggest that the consequences of MIA on mBDNF secretion may underlie the increased risk of cognitive disorder. There is little evidence for whether the expression of its precursor, proBDNF, is changed and how proBDNF-mediated signaling may involve in learning and memory. In this study, proBDNF levels were detected in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions of male adult rats following MIA by prenatal polyI:C exposure. Behaviorally, learning and memory were assessed in contextual fear conditioning tasks. Local field potentials were recorded in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway. The General Partial Directed Coherence approach was utilized to identify the directional alternation of neural information flow between CA3 and CA1 regions. EPSCs were recorded in CA1 pyramidal neurons to explore a possible mechanism involving the proBDNF-p75NTR signaling pathway. Results showed that the expression of proBDNF in the polyI:C-treated offspring was abnormally enhanced in both CA3 and CA1 regions. Meanwhile, the mBDNF expression was reduced in both hippocampal regions. Intra-hippocampal CA1 but not CA3 injection with anti-proBDNF antibody and p75NTR inhibitor TAT-Pep5 effectively mitigated the contextual memory deficits. Meanwhile, reductions in the phase synchronization between CA3 and CA1 and the coupling directional indexes from CA3 to CA1 were enhanced by the intra-CA1 infusions. Moreover, blocking proBDNF/p75NTR signaling could reverse the declined amplitude of EPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons, indicating the changes in postsynaptic information processing in the polyI:C-treated offspring. Therefore, the changes in hippocampal proBDNF activity in prenatal polyI:C exposure represent a potential mechanism involved in NIF disruption leading to contextual memory impairments.", "pmid": "36438556"}

In this study, we focused on lncRNA SNHG6 which plays a role in chemoresistance of cancer cells, but has never been investigated in the context of tamoxifen resistance. We found elevated levels of SNHG6 in tamoxifen-resistant estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells (MCF7TR), relative to naive MCF-7 cells, as well as in tamoxifen-resistant T47D cells (T47DTR), relative to naive T47D cells, which correlated with induced vimentin, ZEB1/2 and decreased e-cadherin, thus implicating a role of EMT in SNHG6-mediated tamoxifen resistance. Downregulation of SNHG6, using specific siRNA, sensitized MCF7TR as well as T47DTR cells to tamoxifen along with markedly reduced proliferation, invasion and anchorage-independent clonogenicity. Further, SNHG6 was found to sponge and inhibit miR-101 as the endogenous expression levels of SNHG6 and miR-101 inversely correlated in paired parental and tamoxifen-resistant cells and, moreover, silencing of SNHG6 in tamoxifen-resistant cells resulted in de-repression of miR-101, along with reversal of EMT. SNHG6 expression also directly correlated with increased stem cells markers Sox2, Oct4 and EZH2. miR-101 levels, manipulated by transfections with pre/anti-miR-101 oligos, directly affected tamoxifen sensitivity of ER-positive cells with pre-miR-101 sensitizing MCF7TR and T47DTR cells to tamoxifen whereas anti-miR-101 inducing resistance of parental MCF-7 and T47D cells to tamoxifen. Further, miR-101 was found to attenuate SNHG6-mediated effects on tamoxifen resistance, EMT as well as stem cell markers, thereby making a case for SNHG6-miR-101 axis in tamoxifen resistance of ER-positive breast cancer cells. Thus, lncRNA SNHG6 is a novel modulator of tamoxifen resistance through its sponging of miR-101 and the resulting effects on EMT.", "pmid": "36212408"}

OBJECTIVE: To establish a minimally invasive profiling of skin cytokines for diagnosis, therapeutic response monitoring, and clinical research in atopic dermatitis (AD) and other skin diseases, particularly in pediatric cohorts. METHODS: We developed a novel method for cytokine profiling in the epidermis using skin tape strips (STSs) in a setting designed to maximize the efficiency of protein extraction from STSs. This method was applied to analyze STS protein extracts from the lesional skin of children having AD (n = 41) and normal, healthy controls (n = 22). A total of 20 cytokines were probed with the ultrasensitive Mesoscale multiplex cytokine assay. RESULTS: A significant increase in interleukin (IL)-1b (P < .01), IL-18 (P < .001), and IL-8 (P < .001) with a decrease in IL-1a (P < .001) in the stratum corneum of AD lesional skin was found. Concurrently, an increase in markers associated with type 2 inflammatory response was readily detectable in AD lesional skin, including C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 22, CCL 17, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). The levels of IL-1b, IL-18, and TSLP exhibited positive correlations with the AD severity index (Scoring AD index) and skin transepidermal water loss (TEWL), whereas an inverse correlation between IL-1a and Scoring AD index and IL-1a and TEWL was found. The levels of CCL17, CCL22, TSLP, IL-22, and IL-17a correlated with skin TEWL measurements. CONCLUSION: Using minimally invasive STS analysis, we identified cytokine profiles easily sampled in AD lesional skin. The expression of these markers correlated with disease severity and reflected changes in TEWL in lesional skin. These markers suggest new response assessment targets for AD skin.

The reported average prevalence of individual inherited NMDs is 3.7-4.99 per 10,000. This number varies greatly in the selected populations after applying population-wide studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of genetic analysis as the first-tier test in patients with NMD and to calculate the disease prevalence and allelic frequencies for reoccurring genetic variants. Methods: Patients with NMD from Latvia with molecular tests confirming their diagnosis in 2008-2020 were included in this retrospective study. Results: Diagnosis was confirmed in 153 unique cases of all persons tested. Next-generation sequencing resulted in a detection rate of 37%. Two of the most common childhood-onset NMDs in our population were spinal muscular atrophy and dystrophinopathies, with a birth prevalence of 1.01 per 10,000 newborns and 2.08 per 10,000 (male newborn population), respectively. The calculated point prevalence was 0.079 per 10,000 for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1, 0.078 per 10,000 for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, 0.073 per 10,000 for nondystrophic congenital myotonia, 0.052 per 10,000 for spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and 0.047 per 10,000 for type 1 myotonic dystrophy. Discussion: DNA diagnostics is a successful approach. The carrier frequencies of the common CAPN3, FKRP, SPG11, and HINT1 gene variants as well as that of the SMN1 gene exon 7 deletion in the population of Latvia are comparable with data from Europe.

Myofibroblasts in the lung are key cellular mediators of IPF progression. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, a major profibrogenic cytokine, induces pulmonary myofibroblast differentiation, and emerging evidence has established the importance of microRNAs (miRs) in the development of IPF. The objective of this study was to define the pro-fibrotic roles and mechanisms of miRs in TGF-beta1-induced pulmonary myofibroblast differentiation. Using RNA sequencing, we identified miR-424 as an important TGF-beta1-induced miR in human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that miR-424 expression was increased by 2.6-fold in HLFs in response to TGF-beta1 and was 1.7-fold higher in human fibrotic lung tissues as compared to non-fibrotic lung tissues. TGF-beta1-induced upregulation of miR-424 was blocked by the Smad3 inhibitor SIS3, suggesting the involvement of this canonical TGF-beta1 signaling pathway. Transfection of a miR-424 hairpin inhibitor into HLFs reduced TGF-beta1-induced expression of classic myofibroblast differentiation markers including alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), whereas a miR-424 mimic significantly enhanced TGF-beta1-induced myofibroblast differentiation. In addition, TGF-beta1 induced Smad3 phosphorylation in HLFs, and this response was reduced by the miR-424 inhibitor. In silico analysis identified Slit2, a protein that inhibits TGF-beta1 profibrogenic signaling, as a putative target of regulation by miR-424. Slit2 is less highly expressed in human fibrotic lung tissues than in non-fibrotic lung tissues, and knockdown of Slit2 by its siRNA enhanced TGF-beta1-induced HLF differentiation. Overexpression of a miR-424 mimic down-regulated expression of Slit2 but not the Slit2 major receptor ROBO1 in HLFs. Luciferase reporter assays showed that the miR-424 mimic represses Slit2 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) reporter activity, and mutations at the seeding regions in the 3'-UTR of Slit2 abolish this inhibition. Together, these data demonstrate a pro-fibrotic role of miR-424 in TGF-beta1-induced HLF differentiation. It functions as a positive feed-back regulator of the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway by reducing expression of the negative regulator Slit2. Thus, targeting miR-424 may provide a new therapeutic strategy to prevent myofibroblast differentiation and IPF progression.", "pmid": "32712053"}

Recent findings indicate that the pathological acetylation state of NF-kappaB/RelA and histone 3 (H3) occurring in the SOD1(G93A) murine model of ALS can be corrected by the synergistic combination of low doses of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-sirtuin 1 pathway activator resveratrol and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors MS-275 (entinostat) or valproate.

Given that apomorphine inhibits passive avoidance retention when given during training or in a defined 10-12h post-training period, we evaluated the ability of nefiracetam to attenuate amnesia induced by dopaminergic agonism. A step-down passive avoidance paradigm was employed and nefiracetam (3 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg) were given alone or in combination during training and at the 10-12h post-training period of consolidation.

However, administration of nefiracetam during training completely reversed the amnesia induced by apomorphine at the 10h post-training time and the converse was also true.

While BRAF V600E tumors are initially responsive to BRAF inhibitors, prolonged treatment results in inhibitor resistance and tumor regrowth. Clinical data have linked the NRAS Q61K, KRAS G13D and MEK1 Q56P mutations to the BRAF inhibitor resistance. However, development of novel therapeutics is hindered by the lack of relevant isogeneic cell models. We employed CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to introduce NRAS Q61K, KRAS G13D and MEK1 Q56P mutations into the A375 melanoma cell line with endogenously high expression of BRAF V600E. The resulting isogenic cell lines are resistant to BRAF inhibitors. The A375 MEK1 Q56P isogenic cells are additionally resistant to MEK inhibitors as single agent, but interestingly, these cells become sensitive to MEK/BRAF inhibitor combo. Our results suggest that resistance in the NRAS and MEK isogenic lines is driven by constitutive MEK/ERK signaling, while the resistance in the KRAS isogenic line is driven by EGFR overexpression. Interestingly, the KRAS G13D isogenic line displays elevated PD-L1 expression suggesting the KRAS G13D mutation could be a potential indication for immunotherapy.

It is not known, however, whether a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta), can function to regulate cancer stem cell (CSC) activity. Using anaplastic thyroid cancer cells (ATC) as a model, we highlight the role of TRbeta in CSC activity. ATC is one of the most aggressive solid cancers in humans and is resistant to currently available therapeutics. Recent studies provide evidence that CSC activity underlies aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance of ATC. Here we show that TRbeta inhibits CSC activity by suppressing tumor-sphere formation of human ATC cells and their tumor-initiating capacity. TRbeta suppresses the expression of CSC regulators, including ALDH, KLF2, SOX2, b-catenin, and ABCG2, in ATC cell-induced xenograft tumors. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis shows that TRbeta reduces CSC population in ATC-induced xenograft tumors. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database demonstrates that the inhibition of CSC capacity by TRbeta contributes to favorable clinical outcomes in human cancer. Our studies show that TRbeta is a newly identified transcription regulator that acts to suppress CSC activity and that TRbeta could be considered as a molecular target for therapeutic intervention of ATC.", "pmid": "35256781"}

Cytochrome P450 2B6 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the CYP2B6 gene. Polymorphisms of this gene play a crucial role in the metabolism of drugs such as Efavirenz. This study aims to evaluate the frequency of three clinically significant CYP2B6 polymorphisms (CYP2B6 * 6 (516G > T), CYP2B6 * 4 (785A > G), and CYP2B6 * 5 (1459C > T)) in three major Iranian ethnicities. Methods: One hundred forty-seven participants from three main Iranian ethnicities were included in this study. After DNA extraction, CYP2B6 * 6 (516G > T), CYP2B6 * 4 (785A > G), and CYP2B6 * 5 (1459C > T) were genotyped using tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). Results: The frequency of the mutated allele in the Iranian population for CYP2B6 * 6 (516G > T) was 41.50 (95% CI: 35.81, 47.36), which was significantly lower than in Kurds (59.62, 95% CI: 45.10, 72.99). Similarly, Kurds had a higher frequency of mutated allele of CYP2B6 * 5 (1459C > T) (46.15%, 95% CI: 32.23, 60.53) than in Iranians (24.49%, 95% CI: 19.68, 29.82). The frequency of A and G alleles of CYP2B6 * 4 (785A > G) was 62.59% (95% CI: 56.78, 68.13) and 37.41 (95% CI: 31.87, 43.22), respectively.

As a representative factor of adaptive immunity, the role of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in lung cancer is still unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of IL-17A on the biological behaviour of lung cancer cells and the relative mechanism. Methods: The human lung adenocarcinoma A549 and H1299 cell lines were used for in vitro study. The effects of IL-17A on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed by CCK-8 assay, wound-healing assay, transwell invasion assay and real-time cell analysis (RTCA). The expression levels of marker proteins in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were detected by western blot analysis. Caspase-1 activity and the concentration of IL-1beta after NLRP3 inflammasome activation were measured by a Caspase-1 Activity Assay Kit and an IL-1beta ELISA kit, respectively. Results: Compared to the control group, IL-17A treatment did not affect the proliferation of A549 and H1299 cells in vitro, but it promoted cell migration, invasion and the EMT process. IL-17A treatment increased NLRP3 expression, caspase-1 activity and IL-1beta level. Blockade of NLRP3 alleviated the cell migration, invasion and the EMT process induced by IL-17A. Conclusions: In conclusion, these findings indicated that NLRP3 participates in the migration, invasion and the EMT process of IL-17A-stimulated lung cells in vitro.", "pmid": "36349316"}

Empagliflozin (EMPA) is a promising drug of choice for the diabetic population. Recent studies have shown its beneficial effects not only on diabetic patients but also on patients suffering from cardiac, hepatic, neurological, or pancreatic anomalies. In this paper, we systematically searched electronic databases to compile literature that focuses on EMPA's effect on the prediabetic population, diabetic population, and hepatic lipid metabolism. We focus on the mechanism of EMPA, specifically by which it increases insulin sensitivity and fat browning and reduces fat accumulation. Overall, we hypothesized that by its effect on weight loss and reducing inflammatory markers and insulin resistance (IR), EMPA decreases the rate of prediabetes to diabetes conversion. We concluded that by improving hepatic and serum triglyceride, decreasing visceral fat, and its positive impact on hepatic steatosis, the drug improves hepatic lipid metabolism.

The co-occurrence of DWS and epilepsy in children is quite rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: We reported a 14-year-old male who presented with a 8-month history of inconsistent upper limb tremor and accidental seizure. The MRI showed the typical alterations of DWS: cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle, vermian hypoplasia, enlarged posterior fossa. He received the ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) placement for hydrocephalus and had a symptom-free period for 8 days. Then he experienced a recurrence of involuntary upper limb tremor and behavior disturbance after decreasing the pressure of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 150 to 130 mm Hg. After being treated with Olanzapine 10 mg/d, Clonazepam 3 mg/qn and Valproate acid (VPA) 500 mg/bid for nearly a month, his mental status and psychotic symptoms fluctuated. A search of Pub Med showed little report of hydrocephalus and DWS comorbidity with seizure and psychosis. Here we presented the whole process of a rare disease from the very beginning with all his symptoms, examinations and treatments. CONCLUSION: VPS placement surgery at an earlier stage may be an effective way to avoid inevitable brain damage so as to improve the clinical outcomes for patients with DWS. Continued treatment with regard to DWS condition may include shunt placement, but it mainly focus on developmental concerns, with occupational and physical therapy along with ongoing supportive psychotherapy to improve the coping skills and quality of life.", "pmid": "36401431"}

Here we present a new insight into the nature of JUL1 as a multi-targeting enzyme for not only JAV1 but also transcription factors (TFs) screened using in vitro and in vivo protein interaction assays. Reporter assays using protoplasts showed that the JUL1-interacting TFs (JiTFs), including ERF15, bZIP53 and ORA59, were involved in transcriptional activation of jasmonate-responsive PDF1.2 and abscisic acid-responsive GEA6. Likewise, assays using mutant plants suggested that the 3 JiTFs were indeed responsible for transcriptional regulation of PDF1.2 and/or GEA6, and ERF15 and ORA59 were substantially responsible for the anti-herbivore trait. In vitro protein ubiqutination assays showed that JUL1 catalyzed ubiqutination of JAV1 but not any of the TFs. This was in accord with the finding that JUL1 abolished JAV1's interference with ERF15 function, according to the reporter assay. Moreover, of great interest is our finding that ERF15 but not bZIP53 or ORA59 serves as a scaffold for the JAV1/JUL1 system, indicating that there is narrow selectivity of the transcriptional reprogramming by the JAV1/JUL1 system.", "pmid": "36674500"}

Here we report that the lncRNA SPRIGHTLY (SPRY4-IT1) gene is upregulated in group 4 medulloblastoma (G4 MB). Methods: SPRIGHTLY expression was assessed in MB subgroup patient-derived xenografts, cell lines, and patient samples. The effect of SPRIGHTLY hemizygous deletion on proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, and colony formation were assessed in vitro and on tumor growth in vivo. dChIRP pull-down assays were used to assess SPRIGHTLY-binding partners, confirmed by immunoprecipitation. SMYD3 DeltaE5 transcripts were examined in cell lines and publicly available RNA-seq data. Pathway analysis was performed by phospho-kinase profiling and RNA-seq. Results: CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of SPRIGHTLY reduced cell viability and invasion and increased apoptosis in G4 MB cell lines in vitro. SPRIGHTLY hemizygous-deleted G4 MB cells injected into mouse cerebellums produced smaller tumors than those derived from parental cells expressing both copies of SPRIGHTLY. SPRIGHTLY lncRNA bound to the intronic region of the SMYD3 pre-mRNA transcript. SPRIGHTLY also interacted with PTPB1 protein to regulate SMYD3 exon skipping to produce an aberrant protein. SPRIGHTLY-driven SMYD3 regulation enhanced the expression of EGFR pathway genes in G4 MB cell lines and activated cell coagulation/hemostasis-related gene expression, suggesting a novel oncogenic role in G4 MB. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the importance of SPRIGHTLY lncRNA as a promoter of G4 MB and the role of the SPRIGHTLY-SMYD3-PTPB1 axis as an important oncogenic regulator in MB.", "pmid": "36267874"}

The primary patency was 50% (6/12 animals). TEVGs were completely replaced with the vascular tissue, free from aneurysms, calcification, atherosclerosis and infection, completely endothelialised, and had clearly distinguishable medial and adventitial layers. Comparative proteomic profiling of TEVGs and contralateral carotid arteries found that TEVGs lacked contractile vascular smooth muscle cell markers, basement membrane components, and proteins mediating antioxidant defense, concurrently showing the protein signatures of upregulated protein synthesis, folding and assembly, enhanced energy metabolism, and macrophage-driven inflammation.

Exercise is recommended as a first-line therapy for women with PCOS to improve their overall health; however, women with PCOS are resistant to the metabolic benefits of exercise training. Here, we aimed to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for such resistance to exercise in PCOS. We employed an in vitro approach with electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) of cultured skeletal muscle cells to explore whether myotubes from women with PCOS have an altered gene expression signature in response to contraction. Following EPS, 4719 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05) in myotubes from women with PCOS compared to 173 in healthy women. Both groups included genes involved in skeletal muscle contraction. We also determined the effect of two transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) ligands that are elevated in plasma of women with PCOS, TGFbeta1 and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), alone and on the EPS-induced response. While AMH (30 ng/ml) had no effect, TGFbeta1 (5 ng/ml) induced the expression of extracellular matrix genes and impaired the exercise-like transcriptional signature in myotubes from women with and without PCOS in response to EPS by interfering with key processes related to muscle contraction, calcium transport and actin filament. Our findings suggest that while the fundamental gene expression responses of skeletal muscle to contraction is intact in PCOS, circulating factors like TGFbeta1 may be responsible for the impaired adaptation to exercise in women with PCOS. KEY POINTS: Gene expression responses to in vitro contraction (electrical pulse stimulation, EPS) are altered in myotubes from women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared to healthy controls, with an increased expression of genes related to pro-inflammatory pathways. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) upregulates genes related to extracellular matrix remodelling and reduces the expression of contractile genes in myotubes, regardless of the donor's health status. TGFbeta1 alters the gene expression response to EPS, providing a possible mechanism for the impaired exercise adaptations in women with PCOS.", "pmid": "35760527"}

This study identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and putative genes responsible for body weight (BW) and antibody response (AbR) to Newcastle disease (ND) in Rwanda indigenous chicken (IC) using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Multiple testing was corrected using chromosomal false detection rates of 5 and 10% for significant and suggestive thresholds, respectively. BioMart data mining and variant effect predictor tools were used to annotate SNPs and candidate genes, respectively. A total of four significant SNPs (rs74098018, rs13792572, rs314702374, and rs14123335) significantly (p <= 7.6E-5) associated with BW were identified on chromosomes (CHRs) 8, 11, and 19. In the vicinity of these SNPs, four genes such as pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1), GPATCH1, MPHOSPH6, and MRM1 were identified. Four other significant SNPs (rs314787954, rs13623466, rs13910430, and rs737507850) all located on chromosome 1 were strongly (p <= 7.6E-5) associated with chicken antibody response to ND.

Stem cell homeostasis in shoot and root tips depends on negative regulation by ligand-receptor pairs of the CLE peptide and leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) families. However, regulation of the cambium, the stem cell niche required for lateral growth of shoots and roots, is poorly characterized. Here we show that the LRR-RLK MOL1 is necessary for cambium homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana. By employing promoter reporter lines, we reveal that MOL1 is active in a domain that is distinct from the domain of the positively acting CLE41/PXY signaling module. In particular, we show that MOL1 acts in an opposing manner to the CLE41/PXY module and that changing the domain or level of MOL1 expression both result in disturbed cambium organization. Underlining discrete roles of MOL1 and PXY, both LRR-RLKs are not able to replace each other when their expression domains are interchanged. Furthermore, MOL1 but not PXY is able to rescue CLV1 deficiency in the shoot apical meristem. By identifying genes mis-expressed in mol1 mutants, we demonstrate that MOL1 represses genes associated with stress-related ethylene and jasmonic acid hormone signaling pathways which have known roles in coordinating lateral growth of the Arabidopsis stem. Our findings provide evidence that common regulatory mechanisms in different plant stem cell niches are adapted to specific niche anatomies and emphasize the importance of a complex spatial organization of intercellular signaling cascades for a strictly bidirectional tissue production.", "pmid": "26991973"}

Thus, identifying diagnostic biomarkers could offer a non-invasive diagnosis for community or home-based triage of symptomatic or asymptomatic women. Herein, this study identified high-risk pathogenic nsSNPs in the NRAS gene. The nsSNPs of NRAS were retrieved from the NCBI database. PROVEAN, SIFT, PolyPhen-2, SNPs&GO, PhD-SNP and PANTHER were used to predict the pathogenicity of the nsSNPs. Eleven nsSNPs were identified as \"damaging\", and further stability analysis using I-Mutant 2.0 and MutPred 2 indicated eight nsSNPs to cause decreased stability (DDG scores < -0.5). Post-translational modification and protein-protein interactions (PPI) analysis showed putative phosphorylation sites.

However, its expression in cells or tissues and function, particularly factor XIII subunit B (FXIII-B), remains controversial. Hemorrhagic FXIII deficiency following anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody treatment has been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients receiving this biologics have reduced FXIII activity when compared to the activity in those treated with other biologics. The relationship between pro-inflammatory cytokines and FXIII expression remains unknown. METHODS: To investigate the expression pattern of FXIII in synovial tissues, immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR, and western blotting were performed. FXIII-A expressed monocyte-derived macrophages were treated with recombinant IL-6 and anti-IL-6 receptor antibody. RNA sequencing of FXIII-B-overexpressing cells was performed to clarify the function of FXIII-B. RESULTS: The immunohistochemical analysis of synovial tissues revealed that factor XIII subunit A (FXIII-A) was expressed in M2 macrophages, and FXIII-B was expressed in fibroblast-like synoviocytes. IL-6 stimulation upregulated FXIII-A expression in IL-4-induced monocyte-derived macrophages, and the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody suppressed FXIII-A expression. FXIII-B was more abundantly secreted in the supernatant of fibroblast-like synoviocytes compared with that of other cells. RNA sequencing showed that FXIII-B elevated the expression of genes associated with anti-apoptotic molecules and chemokines.

We previously revealed that SUSD4 can act as complement inhibitor and as a potential tumor suppressor. METHODS: In a syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer, tumors expressing SUSD4 had a smaller volume compared with the corresponding mock control tumors. Additionally, data from three different expression databases and online analysis tools confirm that for breast cancer patients, high mRNA expression of SUSD4 in the tumor tissue correlates with a better prognosis. In vitro experiments utilized triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (BT-20 and MDA-MB-468) stably expressing SUSD4. Moreover, we established a cell line based on BT-20 in which the gene for EGFR was knocked out with the CRISPR-Cas9 method. RESULTS: We discovered that the Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) interacts with SUSD4. Furthermore, triple-negative breast cancer cell lines stably expressing SUSD4 had higher autophagic flux. The initiation of autophagy required the expression of EGFR but not phosphorylation of the receptor. Expression of SUSD4 in the breast cancer cells led to activation of the tumor suppressor LKB1 and consequently to the activation of AMPKalpha1. Finally, autophagy was initiated after stimulation of the ULK1, Atg14 and Beclin-1 axis in SUSD4 expressing cells.

This study tested the hypothesis that the reduction in WAT mass in chronic alcohol-fed mice is associated with a decreased protein synthesis specifically related to impaired function of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). METHODS: Adult male mice were provided an alcohol-containing liquid diet for 24 weeks or an isonitrogenous isocaloric control diet. In vivo protein synthesis was determined at this time and thereafter epididymal WAT (eWAT) was excised for analysis of signal transduction pathways central to controling protein synthesis and degradation. RESULTS: While chronic alcohol feeding decreased whole-body and eWAT mass, this was associated with a discordant increase in protein synthesis in eWAT. This increase was not associated with a change in mTOR, 4E-BP1, Akt, or PRAS40 phosphorylation. Instead, a selective increase in phosphorylation of S6K1 and its downstream substrates, S6 and eIF4B was detected in alcohol-fed mice. Alcohol also increased eEF2K phosphorylation and decreased eEF2 phosphorylation consistent with increased translation elongation. Alcohol increased Atg12-5, LC3B-I and -II, and ULK1 S555 phosphorylation, suggesting increased autophagy, while markers of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 and -9, and PARP) were unchanged. Lipolytic enzymes (ATGL and HSL phosphorylation) were increased and lipogenic regulators (PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha) were decreased in eWAT by alcohol. Although alcohol increased TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta mRNA, no change in key components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, ACS, and cleaved caspase-1) was detected suggesting alcohol did not increase pyroptosis. Plasma insulin did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the alcohol-induced decrease in whole-body fat mass resulted in part from activation of autophagy in eWAT as protein synthesis was increased and mediated by the specific increase in the activity of S6K1.", "pmid": "27464336"}

In a previous study, we showed that inhibition of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-like-2 (NFE2L2; NRF2), a master regulator of many genes coping with electrophilic and oxidative stress, elevated the level of miR-181c and induced mitochondrial dysfunction in colon cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrate that NRF2-silencing hindered HIF-1alpha accumulation in hypoxic breast cancer cells and subsequently suppressed hypoxia-inducible expression of glycolysis-associated glucose transporter-1, hexokinase-2, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1, and lactate dehydrogenase A. HIF-1alpha dysregulation in NRF2-silenced cancer cells was associated with miR-181c elevation. Overexpression of miR-181c in breast cancer cells blocked HIF-1alpha accumulation and diminished hypoxia-inducible levels of glycolysis enzymes, whereas the inhibition of miR-181c in NRF2-silenced cells restored HIF-1alpha accumulation. In a subsequent metabolomic analysis, hypoxic incubation increased the levels of metabolites involved in glycolysis and activated the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in control cells. However, these elevations were less pronounced in NRF2-silenced cells. In particular, hypoxic incubation increased the levels of amino acids, which implies a shift to catabolic metabolism, and the increased levels were higher in control cells than in NRF2-silenced cells. Concurrently, hypoxia activated BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3)-mediated autophagy in the control cells and miR-181c was found to be involved in this autophagy activation. Taken together, these results show that hypoxia-induced metabolic changes to glycolysis, the PPP, and autophagy are inhibited by NRF2-silencing through miR-181c-mediated HIF-1alpha dysregulation. Therefore, targeting NRF2/miR-181c could be an effective strategy to counteract HIF-1alpha-orchestrated metabolic adaptation of hypoxic cancer cells.", "pmid": "31078780"}

Mechanistically, USP44 co-localized and interacted with WDR5, leading to the repression of its ubiquitination and degradation. Interestingly, WDR5 overexpression abolished the apoptosis induced by USP44 knockdown. Consistently, the in vivo study revealed that USP44 knockdown restricted the leukemic engraftments in the bone marrow and spleens and reduced the infiltration of T-ALL cells in the livers and lungs. In conclusion, this study indicated that USP44 enhanced the growth of T-ALL through interacting with WDR5 and repressing its ubiquitination. This study highlights the potential use of USP44 as a therapeutic target of T-ALL.", "pmid": "36483601"}

Inflammatory pathways have been examined as potential therapeutic targets for diabetic retinopathy, but there is still a need for early-stage treatments. We hypothesized that the CD40-TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6) axis plays a pivotal role in the onset of diabetic retinopathy, and that the CD40-TRAF6 axis would be a prime therapeutic target for early-stage non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The CD40-TRAF6 complex can initiate NFkappaB activation, inflammation, and tissue damage. Further, CD40 and TRAF6 are constitutively expressed on Muller glia, and upregulated in the diabetic retina. Yet the role of the CD40-TRAF6 complex in the onset of diabetic retinopathy is still unclear. In the current study, we examined the CD40-TRAF6 axis in diabetic retinopathy using a small molecule inhibitor (SMI-6877002) on streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. When CD40-TRAF6-dependent inflammation was inhibited, retinal vascular leakage and capillary degeneration was ameliorated in diabetic mice. Collectively, these data suggest that the CD40-TRAF6 axis plays a pivotal role in the onset of diabetic retinopathy, and could be a novel therapeutic target for early diabetic retinopathy.", "pmid": "36309487"}

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is involved in the occurrence of diabetes and hypertension. However, the mechanism by which obesity is related to T2DM induced hypertension is unclear. In this study, we observed that blood pressure and serum renin content were increased in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), as an endogenous bioactive molecule, has been shown to be a vasodilator. Db/db mice, characterized by obesity and T2DM, and juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, which line the afferent arterioles at the entrance of the glomeruli to produce renin, treated with glucose, palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA), were used as animal and cellular models. NaHS, the H2S donor, was administered to db/db mice through intraperitoneal injection. NaHS significantly alleviated blood pressure in db/db mice, decreased the renin content in the serum of db/db mice and reduced renin secretion from JG cells. NaHS modulated renin release via cAMP and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), including synaptosome-associated protein 23 (SNAP23) and vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), which mediate renin exocytosis. Furthermore, NaHS increased the levels of autophagy-related proteins and colocalization with EGFP-LC3 puncta with renin-containing granules and VAMP2 to consume excessive renin to maintain intracellular homeostasis. Therefore, exogenous H2S attenuates renin release and promotes renin-vesicular autophagy to relieve diabetes-induced hypertension.", "pmid": "36675205"}

Whether maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) causes fetal hypoxia remains unclear. We used fetal liver from a baboon (Papio sp.) model of intrauterine growth restriction due to MNR (70% global diet of Control) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells as a model for human fetal hepatocytes and tested the hypothesis that mTOR-mediated IGFBP-1 hyperphosphorylation in response to hypoxia requires hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and regulated in development and DNA-damage responses-1 (REDD-1) signaling. Western blotting (n = 6) and immunohistochemistry (n = 3) using fetal liver indicated greater expression of HIF-1alpha, REDD-1 as well as erythropoietin and its receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor at GD120 (GD185 term) in MNR versus Control. Moreover, treatment of HepG2 cells with hypoxia (1% pO2 ) (n = 3) induced REDD-1, inhibited mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) activity and increased IGFBP-1 secretion/phosphorylation (Ser101/Ser119/Ser169). HIF-1alpha inhibition by echinomycin or small interfering RNA silencing prevented the hypoxia-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 and induction of IGFBP-1 secretion/phosphorylation. dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) induced HIF-1alpha and also REDD-1 expression, inhibited mTORC1 and increased IGFBP-1 secretion/phosphorylation. Induction of HIF-1alpha (DMOG) and REDD-1 by Compound 3 inhibited mTORC1, increased IGFBP-1 secretion/ phosphorylation and protein kinase PKCalpha expression. Together, our data demonstrate that HIF-1alpha induction, increased REDD-1 expression and mTORC1 inhibition represent the mechanistic link between hypoxia and increased IGFBP-1 secretion/phosphorylation. We propose that maternal undernutrition limits fetal oxygen delivery, as demonstrated by increased fetal liver expression of hypoxia-responsive proteins in baboon MNR.

Recent structures of the MLL1-WRAD core complex, which comprises the MLL1 methyltransferase, WDR5, RbBp5, Ash2L, and DPY-30, have revealed variability in the docking of MLL1-WRAD on nucleosomes. In addition, portions of the Ash2L structure and the position of DPY30 remain ambiguous. We used an integrated approach combining cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and mass spectrometry cross-linking to determine a structure of the MLL1-WRAD complex bound to ubiquitinated nucleosomes. The resulting model contains the Ash2L intrinsically disordered region (IDR), SPRY insertion region, Sdc1-DPY30 interacting region (SDI-motif), and the DPY30 dimer. We also resolved three additional states of MLL1-WRAD lacking one or more subunits, which may reflect different steps in the assembly of MLL1-WRAD. The docking of subunits in all four states differs from structures of MLL1-WRAD bound to unmodified nucleosomes, suggesting that H2B-ubiquitin favors assembly of the active complex.

The hypothesis tested in this study was that Lag3 deficiency in dendritic cells (DCs) would significantly affect cytokine expression, alter cellular metabolism, and prime naive T cells to greater effector differentiation. Experimental approaches used included differentiation of murine bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) to measure secreted cytokines, cellular metabolism, RNA sequencing, whole cell proteomics, adoptive OT-II CD4+Lag3 +/+ donor cells into wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and Lag3 -/- recipient mice, and ex vivo measurements of IFN-gamma from cultured splenocytes. Results showed that Lag3 -/- BMDCs secreted more TNF-alpha, were more glycolytic, used fewer fatty acids for mitochondrial respiration, and glycolysis was significantly reduced by exogenous IL-10 treatment. Under basal conditions, RNA sequencing revealed increased expression of CD40 and CD86 and other cytokine-signaling targets as compared with WT. Whole cell proteomics identified a significant number of proteins up- and downregulated in Lag3 -/- BMDCs, with significant differences noted in exogenous IL-10 responsiveness compared with WT cells. Ex vivo, IFN-gamma expression was significantly higher in Lag3 -/- mice as compared with WT. With in vivo adoptive T cell and in vitro BMDC:T coculture experiments, Lag3 -/- BMDCs showed greater T cell effector differentiation and proliferation, respectively, compared with WT BMDCs.

In recent decades, graphene analogs, such as Mxene, an emerging class of two-dimensional (2D) graphene analogs, have been drawing considerable attention based on their intrinsic physicochemical properties and performance as potential candidates for tumor therapy, particularly for therapeutic purposes. Here we explored the targeted drug delivery in cervical cancer in in vivo model. Mxene-based nanocarriers are not able to be precisely controlled in cancer treatment. Method: To solve this problem, the titanium carbide-magnetic core-shell nanocarrier (Ti3C2-Fe3O4@SiO2-FA) is also developed to provide synergetic anticancer with magnetic controlling ability along with pH-responsive drug release. A xenograft model of the cervix was used to investigate the effects of Cisplatin alone, or in combination with Ti3C2@FA and Ti3C2@ Fe3O4@SiO2-FA, on tumor growth following histological staining for evaluation of necrosis. Result and Discussion: A significant tumor-growth suppression effect is shown when the Ti3C2-Fe3O4@SiO2-FA nanocarrier is magnetically controlled Cisplatin drug release. It reveals a synergistic therapeutic efficacy used in conjunction with pharmaceuticals (p < .001). According to the in vivo study, the Ti3C2@FA@Cisplatin nanocomposite exhibits less tumor growth than the drug alone or Ti3C2@FA@Cisplatin via increasing necrosis effect (p < .001). Through this study, Mxene nanosheets are expanded for biomedical applications, not only through the fabrication of biocompatible magnetic Mxene nanocomposite but also through the development of functionalization strategies that enable the magnetic Ti3C2 nanocomposite to load high levels of Cisplatin for cervical cancer treatment (242.5%). Hence, Ti3C2-Fe3O4@SiO2-FA nanocarriers would be promising candidates to improve cancer treatment efficiency.", "pmid": "36761295"}

It is expressed by the secretory cells lining the female reproductive tract, and its deletion during development results in atresia of reproductive tract organs. Nearly all ovarian carcinomas express PAX8, and its knockdown results in apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. To explore the role of PAX8 in these tissues, we purified the PAX8 protein complex from nonmalignant fallopian tube cells and high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma cell lines. We found that PAX8 was a member of a large chromatin remodeling complex and preferentially interacted with SOX17, another developmental transcription factor. Depleting either PAX8 or SOX17 from cancer cells altered the expression of factors involved in angiogenesis and functionally disrupted tubule and capillary formation in cell culture and mouse models. PAX8 and SOX17 in ovarian cancer cells promoted the secretion of angiogenic factors by suppressing the expression of SERPINE1, which encodes a proteinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic effects. The findings reveal a non-cell-autonomous function of these transcription factors in regulating angiogenesis in ovarian cancer.", "pmid": "35380877"}

Therefore, the association of IL-33/ST2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with CAD prevalence, prognosis, and risk factors was assessed by performing a meta-analysis. Through a literature search of relevant articles in various databases using the relevant keywords, seven studies were included in the analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the IL-33/ST2 axis was associated with increased CAD risk [pooled odds ratio (OR) = 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.20].

GEPIA was employed to find the difference of the expression level of MTDH and MYB protooncogene-like 2 (MYBL2) in glioma tissues and normal tissues, and real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot (WB) were applied to verify the differential gene expression of MTDH and MYBL2 cells.

The transwell assay was utilized to investigate the ability of cell migration and invasion. The results showed that MTDH and MYBL2 were overexpressed in glioma cells compared with normal cells. The knockdown of MTDH would inhibit the expression of MYBL2 through decreasing the expression of FoxM1 and further reduce glioma cell proliferation and cell migration and invasion.

Gastrointestinal toxicity and occasional renal toxicity were observed in patients taking it for a long-term period. Meloxicam's late attainment of peak plasma concentration results in a slow onset of action. The goal of the current study was to prepare and characterize chitosan encapsulated meloxicam nanoparticles (CEMNPs) with high bioavailability and less gastro intestinal toxicity in order to prevent such issues. The size of the prepared CEMNPs was approximately 110-220 nm with a zetapotential of +39.9 mV and polydispersity index of 0.268, suggesting that they were uniformly dispersed nanoparticles. The FTIR and UV-Vis spectroscopy have confirmed the presence of MLX in the prepared CEMNPs. The pharmacokinetics have been studied with three groups of male Wistar rats receiving either of the treatments, viz., 4 mg kg-1 of MLX and 1 or 4 mg kg-1 of CEMNPs. Plasma samples were collected until 48 h post administration, and concentrations of MLX were quantified by using reverse (C18) phase HPLC. Non-compartmental analysis was applied to determine pharmacokinetic variables. Upon oral administration, the maximum concentration (Cmax) was reached in 4 h for CEMNPs and 6 h for MLX.

T-type calcium channel blockers reduce platelet granule exocytosis and aggregation. However, studies of the T-type calcium channel in platelets are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression and role of Cav 3.2 in platelet function. METHODS: Global Cav 3.2-/- and platelet-specific Cav 3.2-/- mice and littermate controls were used for this study. Western blot analysis was used to detect the presence of Cav 3.2 and activation of the calcium-responsive protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Fura-2 dye was used to assess platelet calcium. Flow cytometry and light transmission aggregometry were used to evaluate platelet activation markers and aggregation, respectively. FeCl3 -induced thrombosis and a microfluidic flow device were used to assess in vivo and ex vivo thrombosis, respectively. RESULTS: Cav 3.2 was expressed in mouse platelets. As compared with wild-type controls, Cav 3.2-/- mouse platelets showed reduced calcium influx. Similarly, treatment with the T-type calcium channel inhibitor Ni2+ decreased the calcium influx in wild-type platelets. As compared with controls, both Cav 3.2-/- and Ni2+ -treated wild-type platelets showed reduced activation of ERK.

However, the oncostatic function of melatonin on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains elusive. This study was conducted to investigate the potential effect and underlying molecular mechanism of melatonin as single anticancer agent against ESCC cells. METHODS: ESCC cell lines treated with or without melatonin were used in this study. In vitro colony formation and EdU incorporation assays, and nude mice tumor xenograft model were used to confirm the proliferative capacities of ESCC cells. RNA-seq, qPCR, Western blotting, recombinant lentivirus-mediated target gene overexpression or knockdown, plasmids transfection and co-IP were applied to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism by which melatonin inhibited ESCC cell growth. IHC staining on ESCC tissue microarray and further survival analyses were performed to explore the relationship between target genes' expression and prognosis of ESCC. RESULTS: Melatonin treatment dose-dependently inhibited the proliferative ability and the expression of histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7), c-Myc and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) in ESCC cells (P < 0.05). The expressions of HDAC7, c-Myc and USP10 in tumors were detected significantly higher than the paired normal tissues from 148 ESCC patients (P < 0.001). Then, the Kaplan-Meier survival analyses suggested that ESCC patients with high HDAC7, c-Myc or USP10 levels predicted worse overall survival (Log-rank P < 0.001). Co-IP and Western blotting analyses further revealed that HDAC7 physically deacetylated and activated beta-catenin thus promoting downstream target c-Myc gene transcription. Notably, our mechanistic study validated that HDAC7/beta-catenin/c-Myc could form the positive feedback loop to enhance ESCC cell growth, and USP10 could deubiquitinate and stabilize HDAC7 protein in the ESCC cells. Additionally, we verified that inhibition of the HDAC7/beta-catenin/c-Myc axis and USP10/HDAC7 pathway mediated the anti-proliferative action of melatonin on ESCC cells.

Here we assessed the role of soluble (pro)renin receptor (sPRR), a product of site-1 protease-mediated cleavage of (pro)renin receptor (PRR), as a possible ligand of the AT1R in mediating: (i) endothelial cell dysfunction in vitro and (ii) arterial dysfunction in mice with diet-induced obesity. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with a recombinant histidine-tagged sPRR (sPRR-His) exhibited IkappaBalpha degradation concurrent with NF-kappaB p65 activation. These responses were secondary to sPRR-His evoked elevations in Nox4-derived H2O2 production that resulted in inflammation, apoptosis and reduced NO production. Each of these sPRR-His-evoked responses was attenuated by AT1R inhibition using Losartan (Los) but not ACE inhibition using captopril (Cap). Further mechanistic exploration revealed that sPRR-His activated AT1R downstream Gq signaling pathway. Immunoprecipitation coupled with autoradiography experiments and radioactive ligand competitive binding assays indicate sPRR directly interacts with AT1R via Lysine199 and Asparagine295. Important translational relevance was provided by findings from obese C57/BL6 mice that sPRR-His evoked endothelial dysfunction was sensitive to Los. Besides, sPRR-His elevated blood pressure in obese C57/BL6 mice, an effect that was reversed by concurrent treatment with Los but not Cap. Collectively, we provide solid evidence that the AT1R mediates the functions of sPRR during obesity-related hypertension.

The understanding of potential molecular targets is necessary for clinical implications in precision diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a major deacetylase enzyme, is a promising target for cancer therapy; however, the molecular mechanism regulating cancer pathogenesis is largely unknown. METHODS: The clinical relevance of HDAC6 expression levels and their correlation with the overall survival rate were analyzed based on the TCGA and GEO databases. HDAC6 expression in clinical samples obtained from lung cancer tissues and patient-derived primary lung cancer cells was evaluated using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The potential regulatory mechanism of HDAC6 was identified by proteomic analysis and validated by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, microtubule sedimentation, and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays using a specific inhibitor of HDAC6, trichostatin A (TSA) and RNA interference to HDAC6 (siHDAC6). Lung cancer cell growth was assessed by an in vitro 2-dimensional (2D) cell proliferation assay and 3D tumor spheroid formation using patient-derived lung cancer cells. RESULTS: HDAC6 was upregulated in lung cancer specimens and significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Inhibition of HDAC6 by TSA and siHDAC6 caused downregulation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), which was dependent on the tubulin acetylation status. Tubulin acetylation induced by TSA and siHDAC6 mediated the dissociation of p-ERK on microtubules, causing p-ERK destabilization. The proteomic analysis demonstrated that the molecular chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) was an important scaffolder required for p-ERK localization on microtubules, and this phenomenon was significantly inhibited by either TSA, siHDAC6, or siGRP78. In addition, suppression of HDAC6 strongly attenuated an in vitro 2D lung cancer cell growth and an in vitro 3D patient derived-lung cancer spheroid growth. CONCLUSIONS: HDAC6 inhibition led to upregulate tubulin acetylation, causing GRP78-p-ERK dissociation from microtubules. As a result, p-ERK levels were decreased, and lung cancer cell growth was subsequently suppressed. This study reveals the intriguing role and molecular mechanism of HDAC6 as a tumor promoter, and its inhibition represents a promising approach for anticancer therapy.", "pmid": "36639650"}

The cytotoxic effect of this drug combination was also evaluated against two non-tumorigenic cell lines (MCF-10A and MCF-12A). Finally, the ability of pirfenidone to sensitize NCI-H460 cells to a combination of paclitaxel plus carboplatin was assessed. The results demonstrated that pirfenidone sensitized NCI-H460 cells to paclitaxel treatment, reducing cell growth, viability and proliferation, inducing alterations in the cell cycle profile and causing an increase in the % of cell death. Remarkably, this combination did not increase cytotoxicity in non-tumorigenic cells. Importantly, pirfenidone also sensitized NCI-H460 cells to paclitaxel plus carboplatin. This work highlights the possibility of repurposing pirfenidone in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC.", "pmid": "35408988"}

Curcumin, an effective component extracted from Curcuma longa, exhibits antioxidation, regulation of bone metabolism and hypoglycemic effects. The BMSC-mediated osteogenesis and angiogenesis coupling seems to be important in bone formation and regeneration. We aimed to explore the effect of curcumin on BMSC-mediated osteogenesis-angiogenesis coupling in high glucose conditions and underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that high glucose impaired the osteogenic and proangiogenic ability of BMSCs and that curcumin pretreatment rescued the BMSC dysfunction induced by high-concentration glucose. Inhibition of the high glucose-activated NF-kappaB signaling pathway has been found to contribute to the protective effects of curcumin on high glucose-inhibited coupling of osteogenesis and angiogenesis in BMSCs. Furthermore, accelerated bone loss and decreased type H vessels were observed in diabetic osteoporosis mice models. However, curcumin treatment prevented bone loss and promoted vessel formation in diabetic osteoporosis mice. Based on these results, we concluded that curcumin ameliorated diabetic osteoporosis by recovering the osteogenesis and angiogenesis coupling of BMSCs in hyperglycemia, partly through inhibiting the high glucose-activated NF-kappaB signaling pathway.", "pmid": "36387354"}

The ubiquitous concomitant drug scenario in the clinic has spawned a large number of co-analyses based on this technique. However, signal suppression caused by concomitant drugs during electrospray ionization may affect the quantification accuracy of analytes, which has not received enough attention. In this study, metformin (MET) and glyburide (GLY) were co-eluted by the conventional optimization of chromatographic conditions to illustrate the effect of signal suppression caused by the combined drugs on the quantitative analysis. The response of MET was not affected by GLY over the investigated concentration range. However, the GLY signal could be suppressed by about 30% in the presence of MET, affecting its pharmacokinetic analysis in simulated samples. As an attempt to solve the suppression of GLY by co-eluting MET, dilution can alleviate the suppression. However, this method still has limitations due to the sacrifice of sensitivity. The stable isotope-labeled internal standard could play a role in correction and improve the quantitative accuracy of GLY, which was further confirmed in the pharmacokinetic study of simulated samples. This study provided an example model to illustrate the possible effect of clinical drug combination on LC-MS/MS drug quantitative analysis and investigated the effective methods to solve this problem.", "pmid": "36677804"}

Paediatricians successfully reduce toxicities by using lower bleomycin doses and substituting carboplatin for cisplatin, while testicular and paediatric immature teratomas (ITs) are safely managed with surgery alone. AIM: The aim was to determine whether reduced-toxicity treatment could rationally be extended to patients older than 18 years. METHODS: Multicentre cohort study was carried out in four large UK cancer centres over 12 years. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight patients were enrolled. Overall survival was 93%, and event-free survival (EFS) was 72%. Neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy (82% BEP) caused 27 potentially chronic toxicities, and one patient subsequently died from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. There was no difference in histology, stage or grade in patients <=/>18 years, and EFS was not different in these age groups (<=18:28% and >18:28%; log-rank P = 0.96). Histological subtype powerfully predicted EFS (log-rank P = 4.9 x 10-7). Neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy reduced future relapse/progression in dysgerminoma (n = 37, chemo:0% vs. no chemo:20%), yolk sac tumour (n = 23, 26.3% vs.75%) and mixed germ cell tumour (n = 32, 40%vs.70%) but not in IT (n = 42, 33% vs.15%). Additionally, we observed no radiological responses to chemotherapy in ITs, pathological IT grade did not predict EFS (univariate hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval: 0.57-1.19, P = 0.94) and there were no deaths in this subtype. CONCLUSION: Survival was excellent but chemotherapy toxicities were severe, implying significant overtreatment. Our data support the extension of reduced-toxicity, paediatric regimens to adults. Our practice-changing findings that IT was chemotherapy resistant and pathological grade uninformative strongly endorse exclusive surgical management of ovarian ITs at all ages.", "pmid": "30954883"}

The present study aimed to investigate the frequency of different HLA alleles in Iranian patients with CBZ- and LTG-induced SJS/TEN. Methods: A case-control study was conducted from 2011 to 2018 at various hospitals affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Shiraz, Iran). A total of 31 patients receiving anticonvulsant drugs (CZB or LTG) were recruited and divided into two groups. The drug-induced group (n=14) included hospitalized patients due to CBZ- or LTG-induced SJS/TEN. The drug-tolerant group (n=17) included individuals receiving CBZ or LTG for at least three months with no adverse effects. In addition, 46 healthy individuals (control group) were recruited. The frequency of HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 alleles in patients with CZB- or LTG-induced SJS/TEN was investigated. HLA typing was performed using the allele-specific polymerase chain reaction method. The Chi square test and Fisher's exact test were used to determine a potential association between SJS/TEN and HLA alleles. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: CBZ- or LTG-induced SJS/TEN was not significantly associated with HLA alleles. However, HLA-DRB1*01 showed a significantly higher frequency in patients with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN than the CBZ-tolerant patients (30% vs. 9%, P=0.07).

METHODS: Family history and clinical data were recorded. The phenotype was documented by both slit lamp and Scheimpflug photography. One cortical lens was evaluated by electron microscopy after cataract extraction. Lenticular phenotyping and genotyping were performed independently with short tandem repeat polymorphism. Linkage analysis was performed, and candidate genes were PCR amplified and screened for mutations on both strands using direct sequencing. RESULTS: Affected individuals had a congenital nuclear lactescent cataract in both eyes. Linkage was observed on chromosome 17 for DNA marker D17S1857 (lod score: 3.44 at theta = 0). Direct sequencing of CRYBA3/A1, which maps to the vicinity, revealed an in-frame 3-bp deletion in exon 4 (279delGAG). This mutation involved a deletion of glycine-91, cosegregated in all affected individuals, and was not observed in unaffected individuals or in 250 normal control subjects from the same ethnic background. Electron microscopy showed that cortical lens fiber morphology was normal. CONCLUSIONS: The DeltaG91 mutation in CRYBA3/A1 is associated with an autosomal dominant congenital nuclear lactescent cataract. A splice mutation (IVS3+1G/A) in this gene has been reported in a zonular cataract with sutural opacities.

ABCB1 is a human gene that encodes P-glycoprotein, an ATP-dependent efflux pump that may influence the pharmacokinetics of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. Using data from 48 young adults (aged 19-25 years) reporting 1-4 days of cannabis use per week who completed a placebo-controlled human laboratory experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the rs2235048 polymorphism of ABCB1 would influence acute responses to smoked cannabis. C-allele carriers reported on average greater frequency of weekly cannabis use compared to the TT genotype carriers (TC/CC mean +- SEM = 2.74 +- 0.14, TT = 1.85 +- 0.24, p = 0.004). After smoking a single cannabis cigarette to their desired high, C-allele carriers had higher area-under-the-curve (AUC) of both THC metabolites (11-OH-THC TC/CC = 7.18 +- 9.64, TT = 3.28 +- 3.40, p = 0.05; THC-COOH TC/CC = 95.21 +- 116.12, TT = 45.92 +- 42.38, p = 0.043), and these results were impact by self-reported ethnicity.

D-serine and glycine bind to one subunit, GluN1, while glutamate binds to the other, GluN2. These agonists bind to the receptor's bi-lobed ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which close around the agonist during receptor activation. To better understand the unexplored mechanisms by which D-serine contributes to receptor activation, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of the GluN1/GluN2A LBD dimer with free D-serine and glutamate agonists. Surprisingly, we observed D-serine binding to both GluN1 and GluN2A LBDs, suggesting that D-serine competes with glutamate for binding to GluN2A. This mechanism is confirmed by our electrophysiology experiments, which show that D-serine is indeed inhibitory at high concentrations. Although free energy calculations indicate that D-serine stabilizes the closed GluN2A LBD, its inhibitory behavior suggests that it either does not remain bound long enough or does not generate sufficient force for ion channel gating. We developed a workflow using pathway similarity analysis to identify groups of residues working together to promote binding. These conformation-dependent pathways were not significantly impacted by the presence of N-linked glycans, which act primarily by interacting with the LBD bottom lobe to stabilize the closed LBD.", "pmid": "36301074"}

Aloe contained anthraquinones and other active compounds which had laxative effect and could modulate constipation. However, the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of aloe in constipation were still unclear. To explore the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of aloe in treating constipation, we employed network pharmacology, molecular docking, and mice experiments in this study. Our network pharmacology indicated that beta-carotene, sitosterol, campest-5-en-3beta-ol, CLR, arachidonic acid, aloe-emodin, quercetin, and barbaloin were the main active ingredients of aloe in treating constipation. Besides, the MAPK signaling pathway was the principal pathway utilized by aloe in treating constipation. Molecular docking results revealed that beta-carotene and sitosterol were acting as interference factors in attenuating inflammation by binding to an accessory protein of ERK, JNK, AKT, and NF-kappaB p65. Otherwise, in vivo experiments, we used diphenoxylate-induced constipation mice model to explore the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of aloe. Results showed that aloe modulated the constipation mice by reducing the discharge time of first melena, improving the fecal conditions, increasing the gastric intestinal charcoal transit ratio, and improving the intestinal secretion in small intestine. Besides, aloe played an important regulation in promoting intestinal motility sufficiency and the levels of neurotransmitters balance with 5-HT, SP, and VIP on constipation mice. Moreover, aloe significantly inhibited the mRNA and proteins expressions of ERK, JNK, AKT and NF-kappaB p65 in colon. Our study proved that aloe could reverse diphenoxylate-induced changes relating to the intestinal motility, intestinal moisture, and inhibition of the MAPK (ERK, JNK)/AKT/NF-kappaB p65 inflammatory pathway.

Sustained inhibition of complex I produces mitochondrial dysfunction, which is related to oxidative injury and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurodegeneration. This study aimed to identify disease-modifying treatments for PD. Unsubstituted phenothiazine (PTZ) is a small and uncharged aromatic imine that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. PTZ lacks significant DA receptor-binding activity and, in the nanomolar range, exhibits protective effects via its potent free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory activities. Given that DAergic neurons are highly vulnerable to oxidative damage and inflammation, we hypothesized that administration of PTZ might confer neuroprotection in different experimental models of PD. Our findings showed that PTZ rescues rotenone (ROT) toxicity in primary ventral midbrain neuronal cultures by preserving neuronal integrity and reducing protein thiol oxidation. Long-term treatment with PTZ improved animal weight, survival rate, and behavioral deficits in ROT-lesioned rats. PTZ protected DA content and fiber density in the striatum and DA neurons in the SN against the deleterious effects of ROT. Mitochondrial dysfunction, axonal impairment, oxidative insult, and inflammatory response were attenuated with PTZ therapy.

Methods: Chinese patients (213) with coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and received clopidogrel were recruited. Thereafter, their ADP-induced platelet inhibition rates (PAIR%) were determined via thromboelastometry. Further, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCC2 were genotyped using high-resolution melting curve (HRM)-PCR, while CYP2C19*2 and *3 polymorphisms were genotyped via real-time PCR. Results: The allele frequencies of ABCC2 rs717620 were 74.88 and 25.12% for the C and T alleles, respectively. Further, ABCC2 rs717620 TT carriers exhibited significantly higher PAIR% values (72.60 +- 27.69) than both CT (61.44 +- 23.65) and CC carriers (52.72 +- 21.99) (p = 0.047 and p = 0.001, respectively), and ABCC2 rs717620 CT carriers showed significantly higher mean PAIR% values than ABCC2 rs717620 CC carriers (p = 0.011).

However, the mechanism by which its presence is important for the overall disease has not been elucidated. Therefore, this study will investigate the mechanism of miR-351 in the process of diabetes mellitus with atherosclerosis through miR-351 gene knockout mice. METHODS: In this study, miR-351-/- C57BL/6 mice were first induced to form a type 2 diabetes mellitus model with atherosclerosis by STZ injection and a high-fat diet. Pathological tests (oil red O, HE, and Masson staining) combined with biochemical indices (TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, TNF-alpha, hs-CRP, NO, SOD, MDA, CAT, and GSH-Px) were performed to evaluate the pathological degree of atherosclerosis in each group. Mouse aortic endothelial cells were treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and 30 mM glucose to establish a diabetic atherosclerosis cell model. Combined with cell oil red O staining and flow cytometry, the effects of silencing miR-351 on lipid accumulation and cell apoptosis in the diabetic atherosclerosis cell model were determined. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to detect the localization and transcription levels of miR-351 in cells. The target genes of miR-351 were predicted by bioinformatics and verified by dual-luciferase activity reporting. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of phosphorylated inosine 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1)/serine/threonine kinase 1 (Akt) and apoptosis-related proteins after transfection with integrin subunit beta3 (ITGB3) small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA). RESULTS: The expression of the miR-351 gene was significantly increased in the high-fat wild-type (HWT) group, and its expression was significantly decreased in the knockout mice. Silencing miR-351 effectively alleviated atherosclerosis in mice. The levels of miR-351 expression, apoptosis, lipid accumulation, and oxidative stress in ox-LDL + high glucose-induced endothelial cells were significantly increased. These phenomena were effectively inhibited in lentivirus-infected miR-351-silenced cell lines. Bioinformatics predicted that miR-351-5p could directly target the ITGB3 gene. Transfection of ITGB3 siRNA reversed the downregulation of apoptosis, decreased oil accumulation, and decreased oxidative stress levels induced by miR-351 silencing. In addition, it inhibited the activation of the PIK3R1/Akt pathway.

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are a highly effective, first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, except in the first trimester of pregnancy, when quinine with clindamycin is recommended due to concerns about the potential embryotoxicity of artemisinins. We compared adverse pregnancy outcomes after artemisinin-based treatment (ABT) versus non-ABTs in the first trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: For this systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Malaria in Pregnancy Library for prospective cohort studies published between Nov 1, 2015, and Dec 21, 2021, containing data on outcomes of pregnancies exposed to ABT and non-ABT in the first trimester. The results of this search were added to those of a previous systematic review that included publications published up until November, 2015. We included pregnancies enrolled before the pregnancy outcome was known. We excluded pregnancies with missing estimated gestational age or exposure information, multiple gestation pregnancies, and if the fetus was confirmed to be unviable before antimalarial treatment. The primary endpoint was adverse pregnancy outcome, defined as a composite of either miscarriage, stillbirth, or major congenital anomalies. A one-stage IPD meta-analysis was done by use of shared-frailty Cox models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015032371. FINDINGS: We identified seven eligible studies that included 12 cohorts. All 12 cohorts contributed IPD, including 34 178 pregnancies, 737 with confirmed first-trimester exposure to ABTs and 1076 with confirmed first-trimester exposure to non-ABTs. Adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred in 42 (5 7%) of 736 ABT-exposed pregnancies compared with 96 (8 9%) of 1074 non-ABT-exposed pregnancies in the first trimester (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0 71, 95% CI 0 49-1 03). Similar results were seen for the individual components of miscarriage (aHR=0 74, 0 47-1 17), stillbirth (aHR=0 71, 0 32-1 57), and major congenital anomalies (aHR=0 60, 0 13-2 87). The risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was lower with artemether-lumefantrine than with oral quinine in the first trimester of pregnancy (25 [4 8%] of 524 vs 84 [9 2%] of 915; aHR 0 58, 0 36-0 92). INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity based on the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or major congenital anomalies associated with ABT during the first trimester of pregnancy. Given that treatment with artemether-lumefantrine was associated with fewer adverse pregnancy outcomes than quinine, and because of the known superior tolerability and antimalarial effectiveness of ACTs, artemether-lumefantrine should be considered the preferred treatment for uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in the first trimester. If artemether-lumefantrine is unavailable, other ACTs (except artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) should be preferred to quinine. Continued active pharmacovigilance is warranted.

The contribution of suPAR to CVD risk and its genetic influence in Black populations have not been evaluated. METHODS: We measured suPAR in 3492 Black adults from the prospective, community-based JHS (Jackson Heart Study). Cross-sectional associations of suPAR with lifestyle and CVD risk factors were assessed, whole-genome sequence data were used to evaluate genetic associations of suPAR, and relationships of suPAR with incident CVD outcomes and overall mortality were estimated over follow-up. RESULTS: In Cox models adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and CRP (C-reactive protein), each 1-SD higher suPAR was associated with a 21% to 31% increased risk of incident coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and mortality. In the genome-wide association study, 2 missense (rs399145 encoding p.Thr86Ala, rs4760 encoding p.Phe272Leu) and 2 noncoding regulatory variants (rs73935023 within an enhancer element and rs4251805 within the promoter) of PLAUR on chromosome 19 were each independently associated with suPAR and together explained 14% of suPAR phenotypic variation. The allele frequencies of each of the four suPAR-associated genetic variants differ considerably across African and European populations. We further show that PLAUR rs73935023 can alter transcriptional activity in vitro.

We investigated the therapeutic effects of an approved botanical drug, cepharanthine (CEP), in a cell culture model of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis rat models both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, CEP and pirfenidone (PFD) suppressed BLM-induced lung tissue inflammation, proliferation of blue collagen fibers, and damage to lung structures in vivo. Furthermore, we also found increased collagen deposition marked by alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and Collagen Type I Alpha 1 (COL1A1), which was significantly alleviated by the addition of PFD and CEP. Moreover, we elucidated the underlying mechanism of CEP against PF in vitro. Various assays confirmed that CEP reduced the viability and migration and promoted apoptosis of myofibroblasts. The expression levels of myofibroblast markers, including COL1A1, vimentin, alpha-SMA, and Matrix Metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2), were also suppressed by CEP. Simultaneously, CEP significantly suppressed the elevated Phospho-NF-kappaB p65 (p-p65)/NF-kappaB p65 (p65) ratio, NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) levels, and elevated inhibitor of NF-kappaB Alpha (IkappaBalpha) degradation and reversed the progression of PF.

Methods: We set out to assess the genetic variants of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance and the effectiveness of its treatment in eastern India prior to, during, and 6 to 8 years following the introduction of the new pharmacological regime. In 2008-2009, 318 P. falciparum-positive patients got the recommended doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. We used 379 additional isolates from 2015 to 2017 in addition to the 106 isolates from 2010. All 803 isolates from two study sites underwent in vitro sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine sensitivity testing and genomic characterisation of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance (pfdhfr and pfdhps). Results: In Kolkata and Purulia, we observed early treatment failure in 30.7 and 14.4% of patients, respectively, whereas recrudescence was found in 8.1 and 13.4% of patients, respectively, in 2008-2009. In 2017, the proportion of in vitro pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine resistance steadily grew in Kolkata and Purulia despite a single use of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Treatment failures with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine were linked to quintuple or quadruple pfdhfr- pfdhps mutations (AICII-AGKAT, AICII-AGKAA, AICII-SGKGT, AICII-AGKAA, AICNI-AGKAA) in 2008-2009 (p < 0.001). The subsequent spread of mutant-haplotypes with higher in vitro sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance (p < 0.001), such as the sextuple (dhfr-AIRNI+dhps-AGEAA, dhfr-ANRNL+dhps-AGEAA) and septuple (dhfr-AIRNI+dhps-AGEAT), mutations were observed in 2015-2017. Discussion: This successive spread of mutations with high in vitro sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance confirmed the progressive increase in antifolate resistance even after an 8-year withdrawal of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.", "pmid": "36583107"}

Here, we report to apply the same CAR to target solid tumors, such as ErbB2+ carcinoma. CD19 CAR T cells are redirected towards the ErbB2+ cells by a fusion protein that is composed of the herceptin-derived anti-ErbB2 scFv 4D5 linked to the CD19 exodomain. The CD19-4D5scFv engager enabled CD19 CAR T cells to recognize the ErbB2+ cancer cells and to suppress the ErbB2+ tumor growth. The primary killing capacity by the ErbB2-redirected CD19 CAR T cells was as efficient as by the ErbB2 CAR T cells, however, adding CD19+ B cells furthermore reinforced the activation of the CD19 CAR T cells, thereby improving the anti-tumor activities. The ErbB2-redirected CD19 CAR T cells, moreover, showed a 100-fold superior selectivity in targeting cancer cells versus healthy fibroblasts, which was not the case for the ErbB2 CAR T cells. The data demonstrate that the CD19 CAR T cells can be high-jacked by a CD19-scFv engager protein to attack specifically solid cancer, thereby expanding their application beyond the B cell malignancies.", "pmid": "36672182"}

We hypothesized that adding sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antitumor and antiangiogenic activity, to an anthracycline and taxane regimen would improve pathologic complete response (pCR) rates to a prespecified endpoint of 45% in patients with HER2-negative LABC or IBC. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, phase II trial of neoadjuvant sunitinib with paclitaxel (S+T) followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF for patients with HER2-negative LABC or IBC. Patients received sunitinib 25 mg PO daily with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV weekly x12 followed by doxorubicin 24 mg/m2 IV weekly + cyclophosphamide 60 mg/m2 PO daily with G-CSF support. Response was evaluated using pCR in the breast and the CPS + EG score (clinical-pathologic scoring + estrogen receptor [ER] and grade). RESULTS: Seventy patients enrolled, and 66 were evaluable for efficacy. Eighteen patients (27%) had pCR in the breast (10 had ER+ disease and 8 had triple-negative disease). When defining response as pCR and/or CPS + EG score <=2, 31 (47%) were responders. In pateints with ER positive disease, 23 (64%) were responders. The most common toxicities were cytopenias and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant S+T followed by AC+G-CSF was safe and tolerable in LABC and IBC. The study did not meet the prespecified endpoint for pCR; however, 47% were responders using pCR and/or CPS + EG score <=2. ER positive patients had the highest response rate (64%). The addition of sunitinib to neoadjuvant chemotherapy may provide promising incremental benefit for patients with ER positive LABC.", "pmid": "34158245"}

(Ericaceae)] with phlegm-reducing and cough-relieving properties, is widely used in China for treating bronchitis and asthma. OBJECTIVE: To present the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, vasoactive, antitumor, and antimicrobial effects of farrerol and its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The literature was reviewed by searching PubMed, Medline, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases between 2011 and May 2021. The following key words were used: 'farrerol,' 'flavanone,' 'anti-inflammatory,' 'antioxidant,' 'vasoactive,' 'antitumor,' 'antimicrobial,' and 'molecular mechanisms'. RESULTS: Farrerol showed anti-inflammatory effects mainly mediated via the inhibition of interleukin (IL)-6/8, IL-1beta, tumour necrosis factor(TNF)-alpha, NF-kappaB, NO, COX-2, JNK1/2, AKT, PI3K, ERK1/2, p38, Keap-1, and TGF-1beta. Farrerol exhibited antioxidant effects by decreasing JNK, MDA, ROS, NOX4, Bax/Bcl-2, caspase-3, p-p38 MAPK, and GSK-3beta levels and enhancing Nrf2, GSH, SOD, GSH-Px, HO-1, NQO1, and p-ERK levels. The vasoactive effects of farrerol were also shown by the reduced alpha-SMA, NAD(P)H, p-ERK, p-Akt, mTOR, Jak2, Stat3, Bcl-2, and p38 levels, but increased OPN, occludin, ZO-1, eNOS, CaM, IP3R, and PLC levels. The antitumor effects of farrerol were evident from the reduced Bcl-2, Slug, Zeb-1, and vimentin levels but increased p27, ERK1/2, p38, caspase-9, Bax, and E-cadherin levels. Farrerol reduced alpha-toxin levels and increased NO production and NF-kappaB activity to impart antibacterial activity. CONCLUSIONS: This review article provides a theoretical basis for further studies on farrerol, with a view to develop and utilise farrerol for treating of vascular-related diseases in the future.", "pmid": "34846222"}

A point mutation in the sequence encoding the Z-DNA-binding domain (ZBD) of ADAR1 is associated with severe autoinflammatory disease3-5. ZBP1 is the only other ZBD-containing mammalian protein6, and its activation can trigger both cell death and transcriptional responses through the kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3, and the protease caspase 8 (refs. 7-9). Here we show that the pathology caused by alteration of the ZBD of ADAR1 is driven by activation of ZBP1. We found that ablation of ZBP1 fully rescued the overt pathology caused by ADAR1 alteration, without fully reversing the underlying inflammatory program caused by this alteration. Whereas loss of RIPK3 partially phenocopied the protective effects of ZBP1 ablation, combined deletion of caspase 8 and RIPK3, or of caspase 8 and MLKL, unexpectedly exacerbated the pathogenic effects of ADAR1 alteration. These findings indicate that ADAR1 is a negative regulator of sterile ZBP1 activation, and that ZBP1-dependent signalling underlies the autoinflammatory pathology caused by alteration of ADAR1.", "pmid": "35859177"}

However, it is nevertheless elusive to what extent exogenous supplementation with mixtures of vitamins ADE, zinc (Zn), and selenium (Se) affects follicular growth and granulosa cells (GCs) molecular function. We herein investigated their effect on follicular growth and GCs physiological function. We showed that follicular growth and ovulation time was accelerated and shortened with the increases of vitamins ADE, Zn, and Se doses by continually monitoring and recording (one estrus cycle of about 21 days) with an ultrasound scanner. Integrated omics analysis showed that there was a sophisticated network relationship, correlation expression, and enrichment pathways of the genes and metabolites highly related to organic acids and their derivatives and lipid-like molecules. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) results showed that vitamin D receptor (VDR), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily m member 6 (TRPM6), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member 6 (TRPV6), solute carrier family 5 member 1 (SLC5A1), arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) had a strong correlation between the transcriptome data. Combined multi-omics analysis revealed that the protein digestion and absorption, ABC transporters, biosynthesis of amino acids, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, mineral absorption, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and ovarian steroidogenesis were significantly enriched. We focused on the gene-metabolite interactions in ovarian steroidogenesis, founding that insulin receptor (INSR), phospholipase a2 group IVA (PLA2G4A), adenylate cyclase 6 (ADCY6), cytochrome p450 family 1 subfamily b member 1 (CYP1B1), protein kinase camp-activated catalytic subunit beta (PRKACB), cytochrome p450 family 17 subfamily a member 1 (CYP17A1), and phospholipase a2 group IVF (PLA2G4F) were negatively correlated with beta-estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), and testosterone (T) (P < 0.05). while ALOX5 was a positive correlation with E2, P4, and T (P < 0.05); cytochrome p450 family 19 subfamily a member 1 (CYP19A1) was a negative correlation with cholesterol (P < 0.01). In mineral absorption, our findings further demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between solute carrier family 26 member 6 (SLC26A6), SLC5A1, and solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) with Glycine and L-methionine. Solute carrier family 40 member 1 (SLC40A1) was a negative correlation with Glycine and L-methionine (P < 0.01). TRPV6 and ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 1 (ATP1A1) were positively associated with Glycine (P < 0.05); while ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit beta 3 (ATP1B3) and cytochrome b reductase 1 (CYBRD1) were negatively related to L-methionine (P < 0.05). These outcomes suggested that the vitamins ADE, Zn, and Se of mixtures play an important role in the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones and mineral absorption metabolism pathway through effects on the expression of the key genes and metabolites in GCs. Meanwhile, these also are required for physiological function and metabolism of GCs. Collectively, our outcomes shed new light on the underlying mechanisms of their effect on follicular growth and GCs molecular physiological function, helping explore valuable biomarkers.", "pmid": "36387403"}

APC deficiency activates WNT signaling, which remains an elusive target for cancer therapy, prompting us to apply the synthetic essentiality framework to identify druggable vulnerabilities for APC-deficient cancers. Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2) was identified as a synthetic essential effector of APC-deficient colorectal cancer. Mechanistically, APC deficiency results in the TCF4/beta-catenin-mediated upregulation of TDO2 gene transcription. TDO2 in turn activates the Kyn-AhR pathway, which increases glycolysis to drive anabolic cancer cell growth and CXCL5 secretion to recruit macrophages into the tumor microenvironment. Therapeutically, APC-deficient colorectal cancer models were susceptible to TDO2 depletion or pharmacologic inhibition, which impaired cancer cell proliferation and enhanced antitumor immune profiles. Thus, APC deficiency activates a TCF4-TDO2-AhR-CXCL5 circuit that affects multiple cancer hallmarks via autonomous and nonautonomous mechanisms and illuminates a genotype-specific vulnerability in colorectal cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies critical effectors in the maintenance of APC-deficient colorectal cancer and demonstrates the relationship between APC/WNT pathway and kynurenine pathway signaling. It further determines the tumor-associated macrophage biology in APC-deficient colorectal cancer, informing genotype-specific therapeutic targets and the use of TDO2 inhibitors.

Here we show that NSD2, via H3K36me2 catalysis, cooperates with oncogenic KRAS signaling to drive lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) pathogenesis. In vivo expression of NSD2E1099K, a hyperactive variant detected in individuals with LUAD, rapidly accelerates malignant tumor progression while decreasing survival in KRAS-driven LUAD mouse models. Pathologic H3K36me2 generation by NSD2 amplifies transcriptional output of KRAS and several complementary oncogenic gene expression programs. We establish a versatile in vivo CRISPRi-based system to test gene functions in LUAD and find that NSD2 loss strongly attenuates tumor progression. NSD2 knockdown also blocks neoplastic growth of PDXs (patient-dervived xenografts) from primary LUAD. Finally, a treatment regimen combining NSD2 depletion with MEK1/2 inhibition causes nearly complete regression of LUAD tumors. Our work identifies NSD2 as a bona fide LUAD therapeutic target and suggests a pivotal epigenetic role of the NSD2-H3K36me2 axis in sustaining oncogenic signaling.", "pmid": "34555356"}

In normal cells, phosphorylation at these sites triggers proteasomal degradation, which prevents accumulation of free cytoplasmic betacat. In cancer cells, stabilized beta-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it associates with TCF/Lef proteins to activate transcription of genes that promote tumorigenesis and metastasis, including PD-L1. It has been suggested that nuclear phospho-betacat (pbetacat) staining may be diagnostically useful in differentiating primary from metastatic melanoma. Also, a pbetacat peptide (residues 30-39, with only S33 phosphorylated) is naturally presented by melanoma cells as a T-cell target. We evaluated expression of pS33-betacat in primary and metastatic melanomas by immunohistochemistry and found its expression varied widely but was most commonly cytoplasmic. Nuclear staining was identified in only 18% of metastatic melanomas. Staining with antibodies to pS33-betacat and pS33/37/T41-betacat was most intense in mitotic melanoma cells; however, pS33-betacat intensity was not significantly associated with AJCC stage, tumor location, BRAF mutation status, or immune infiltrates. Yet, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression by tumor cells were significantly higher in tumors with high pS33-betacat expression. The low rate of nuclear pS33-betacat expression suggests that pS33-betacat may have limited utility for identifying metastatic melanomas. However, high expression in dividing cells and strong associations with PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression may inform future personalized therapies for tumors with high pS33-betacat expression.", "pmid": "34167064"}

Discontinuation of MTX results in remission in half of the patients with MTX-LPDs and is one treatment approach. PATIENT CONCERN: A 64-year-old Japanese woman suffering from rheumatoid arthritis treated with MTX presented with upper abdominal pain. DIAGNOSIS: Pathological evaluation showed that the tumor contained geographic necrosis and proliferation of large atypical lymphocytes strongly positive for cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) antigen with immunohistochemical staining and Epstein-Barr Virus-encoded RNA transcript by in situ hybridization. The tumor was finally diagnosed as a primary hepatic MTX-associated Epstein-Barr Virus positive B-cell LPD. INTERVENTIONS: Left hepatic lobectomy was performed for diagnosis and therapy. OUTCOMES: No sighs of recurrence were observed for 2 years. LESSONS: This patient demonstrated that MTX-LPD could arise in the liver, although it is rare. If liver tumors arise in patients taking MTX, examination of sIL-2R, Epstein-Barr virus-VCA IgG and EBNA might support the diagnosis of MTX-LPD. In this case, the primary hepatic MTX-LPD became necrotic without discontinuation of MTX. It is generally believed that withdrawal of MTX restores antitumor immunity resulting in tumor necrosis. This case indicates that spontaneous regression might occur without any treatment in some patients treated for RA with MTX-LPD. The relationship between MTX-LPD and spontaneous necrosis is unclear and further data is required to characterize the types of patients that will develop spontaneous regression without intervention.", "pmid": "36451467"}

Aneuploid karyotype with a median of 84 chromosomes was possessed by GWH04, as well as chromosomal structural abnormalities, such as broken chromosomes, double centromere chromosomes, homogeneous staining regions, and double microbodies. Gene sequencing further revealed the mutational status of genes TP53, PTEN, PDGFRA, ERBB2, BRCA1, NF1, and MLH1 and the promoter region of telomerase reverse transcriptase (C228T) in this cell line. Altogether, these results indicated that GWH04 will be a useful tool for human GBM studies both in vitro and in vivo.", "pmid": "36169178"}

METHODS: A dataset comprising 13 Norrie-FEVR, one Coat's disease, 31 ROP patients and 90 ex-premature babies of <32 weeks' gestation underwent an ophthalmologic examination and were screened for mutations within the NDP gene by direct DNA sequencing, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or gel electrophoresis. Controls were only screened using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis. Confirmation of mutations identified was obtained by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Evidence for two novel mutations in the NDP gene was presented: Leu103Val in one FEVR patient and His43Arg in monozygotic twin Norrie disease patients. Furthermore, a previously described 14-bp deletion located in the 5' unstranslated region of the NDP gene was detected in three cases of regressed ROP. A second heterozygotic 14-bp deletion was detected in an unaffected ex-premature girl. Only two of the 13 Norrie-FEVR index cases had the full features of Norrie disease with deafness and mental retardation. CONCLUSION: Two novel mutations within the coding region of the NDP gene were found, one associated with a severe disease phenotypes of Norrie disease and the other with FEVR. A deletion within the non-coding region was associated with only mild-regressed ROP, despite the presence of low birthweight, prematurity and exposure to oxygen. In full-term children with retinal detachment only 15% appear to have the full features of Norrie disease and this is important for counselling parents on the possible long-term outcome.", "pmid": "16970763"}

In the case of glioblastoma (GBM), where resistance to radiotherapy frequently occurs, Src kinase is known as one of the molecules responsible for imparting radioresistance to GBM. Thus, we evaluated the effect of AZD0530 on the radiosensitivity of human GBM cells and human glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs). We show that Src activity of GBM and GSC is increased by radiation and inhibited by AZD0530, and using clonogenic assays, AZD0530 enhances the radiosensitivity of GBM and GSCs. Also, AZD0530 induced a prolongation of radiation-induced gammaH2AX without specific cell cycle and mitotic index changes, suggesting that AZD0530-induced radiosensitization in GBM cells and GSCs results from the inhibition of DNA repair. In addition, AZD0530 was shown to inhibit the radiation-induced EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway, which is known to promote and regulate radioresistance and survival of GBM cells by radiation. Finally, mice bearing orthotopic xenografts initiated from GBM cells were then used to evaluate the in vivo response to AZD0530 and radiation. The combination of AZD0530 and radiation showed the longest median survival compared with any single modality. Thus, these results show that AZD0530 enhances the radiosensitivity of GBM cells and GSCs and suggest the possibility of AZD0530 as a clinical radiosensitizer for treatment of GBM.", "pmid": "34158343"}

No interventions are currently available to augment nephron number. We have recently shown that sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) has an important role in dictating proper nephron endowment. The present study explored whether SIRT3 stimulation, by means of supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (NR), a precursor of the SIRT3 co-substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), was able to improve nephron number in a murine model of a low protein (LP) diet. Our findings show that reduced nephron number in newborn mice (day 1) born to mothers fed a LP diet was associated with impaired renal SIRT3 expression, which was restored through supplementation with NR. Glomerular podocyte density, as well as the rarefaction of renal capillaries, also improved through NR administration. In mechanistic terms, the restoration of SIRT3 expression through NR was mediated by the induction of proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha). Moreover, NR restored SIRT3 activity, as shown by the reduction of the acetylation of optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), which resulted in improved mitochondrial morphology and protection against oxidative damage in mice born to mothers fed the LP diet. Our results provide evidence that it is feasible to prevent nephron mass shortage at birth through SIRT3 boosting during nephrogenesis, thus providing a therapeutic option to possibly limit the long-term sequelae of reduced nephron number in adulthood.", "pmid": "36291179"}

Furious efforts to end the pandemic including prevention of spread of SARS-CoV-2, use of antiviral drugs, symptomatic treatments and vaccination are underway. But there are no effective treatments available to save the dying patient in stage 2 (pulmonary) and stage 3 (hyperinflammation) of the infection. The detailed genetic and phenotypical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the spike protein (S1) has increased positive charges (compared to SARS-CoV) on them and are responsible for attachment to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and infection by the virus. In addition, it was also reported that the inflammation in the tissue rendered the lung environment more acidic supporting the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with the cells. We hypothesize that the intermittent use of the oxygen ionizer generating negative oxygen ion clusters [O2-(H2O)n] and sodium bicarbonate nebulizer (generating HCO3-); when connected to ventilator inlet or oxygen concentrator will neutralize the spike protein of the virus in respiratory tract and lungs and change the lung environment to neutral/alkaline condition respectively facilitating improved oxygen pressure in blood.

STING activation also induces LC3B lipidation, a classical but equivocal marker of autophagy, that promotes a cell-autonomous antiviral response that arose before evolution of the interferon pathway. We report that STING activation induces LC3B lipidation onto single-membrane perinuclear vesicles mediated by ATG16L1 via its WD40 domain, bypassing the requirement of canonical upstream autophagy machinery. This process is blocked by bafilomycin A1 that binds and inhibits the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and by SopF, a bacterial effector that catalytically modifies the V-ATPase to inhibit LC3B lipidation via ATG16L1. These results indicate that activation of the cGAS-STING pathway induces V-ATPase-dependent LC3B lipidation that may mediate cell-autonomous host defense, an unanticipated mechanism that is distinct from LC3B lipidation onto double-membrane autophagosomes.", "pmid": "33201170"}

Methods: Triple negative human breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells were cultured and blank control group, single EGFR inhibitor gefitinib group, single mTOR inhibitor everolimus group, and two drug combination group were set up respectively to detect the effects of single and combined drugs on cell proliferation activity, cell cycle and apoptosis, and the expression of EGFR and mTOR signal pathway proteins in cell lines after single and combined drug intervention was detected again by Western blot. Results: The level of EGFR and p-mTOR protein in triple negative breast cancer was higher than in non triple negative breast cancer (P<0.05). The level of mTOR, S6K1, p-EGFR, p-S6K1 was significantly increased when treated with EGF (0ng/mL, 10ng/mL, 100ng/mL) for 1h, compared to without EGF stimulation (P<0.05). The level of p-EGFR, p-mTOR, p-S6K1 protein increased significantly when the cells were exposed to EGF for 2h, respectively (P<0.05). EGFR inhibitor gefitinib alone and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus alone could significantly inhibit the proliferation of human triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). The level of p-4EBP1 protein in EGFR and mTOR signal pathway was significantly increased after the intervention of gefitinib alone, everolimus alone, and the combination of two drugs (P<0.05). Conclusion: EGFR and mTOR signaling pathways can be activated in triple negative breast cancer; Both the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib alone and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus alone can significantly inhibit the proliferation of human triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether mutations in the SLC34A3 gene, which encodes sodium-phosphate cotransporter type IIc, are responsible for the occurrence of HHRH. DESIGN AND SETTING: Mutation analysis of exons and adjacent introns in the SLC34A3 gene was conducted at an academic research laboratory and medical center. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Members of two unrelated families with HHRH participated in the study. RESULTS: Two affected siblings in one family were homozygous for a 101-bp deletion in intron 9. Haplotype analysis of the SLC34A3 locus in the family showed that the two deletions are on different haplotypes. An unrelated individual with HHRH was a compound heterozygote for an 85-bp deletion in intron 10 and a G-to-A substitution at the last nucleotide in exon 7. The intron 9 deletion (and likely the other two mutations) identified in this study causes aberrant RNA splicing. Sequence analysis of the deleted regions revealed the presence of direct repeats of homologous sequences. CONCLUSION: HHRH is caused by biallelic mutations in the SLC34A3 gene. Haplotype analysis suggests that the two intron 9 deletions arose independently. The identification of three independent deletions in introns 9 and 10 suggests that the SLC34A3 gene may be susceptible to unequal crossing over because of sequence misalignment during meiosis.", "pmid": "16849419"}

We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) following anesthesia-induced hypotension. METHODS: Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl (0.15 mg kg(-1)) and propofol (2.0 mg kg(-1)), 13 patients received phenylephrine (0.1 mg iv) and 12 patients received ephedrine (10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP). Heart rate (HR), MAP, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) were registered. RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV, and CO concomitant with an elevation in S(c)O(2). After administration of phenylephrine, MAP increased (51 +/- 12 to 81 +/- 13 mmHg; P < 0.001; mean +/- SD). However, a 14% (from 70 +/- 8% to 60 +/- 7%) reduction in S(c)O(2) (P < 0.05) followed with no change in CO (3.7 +/- 1.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.9 l min(-1)). The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP (53 +/- 9 to 79 +/- 8 mmHg; P < 0.001), restored CO (3.2 +/- 1.2 to 5.0 +/- 1.3 l min(-1)), and preserved S(c)O(2).

Thus, the current study intended to explore the relationship of lnc-MALAT1 to disease risk, features, cytokines, and prognostication in AMI patients. METHODS: This multicenter study consecutively enrolled 160 newly diagnosed AMI patients and 50 controls (angina pectoris patients). Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained to measure lnc-MALAT1 by RT-qPCR. Serum cytokines in AMI patients were detected by ELISA. In addition, AMI patients were followed up for major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) risk evaluation. RESULTS: Lnc-MALAT1 was higher in AMI patients than in controls (median: 2.245 vs. 0.996, p = 0.004), and it also presented a good capacity for differentiating AMI patients from controls with an area under the curve of 0.823. Lnc-MALAT1 was positively related to C-reactive protein (p = 0.005), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.022), cardiac troponin I (p = 0.021), and infarct size (p = 0.007), but not other biochemical indexes in AMI patients.

Numerous client proteins of HSP90 have been identified in known cardiac disease pathways, including MAPK signaling, PI3K/AKT (PKB)/mTOR, and TNF-alpha signaling. Therefore, these pathways can be controlled by regulating HSP90. Among them, the activity of HSP90 can be regulated via numerous inhibitors. In this review, first, we will discuss the function of HSP90 and its role in pathological pathways.

The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting hemolytic anemia. Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders. In general, anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life. Although ribavirin-associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin-associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages.

Participants in the ASPECT-NP trial received ceftolozane/tazobactam (3 g [2 g ceftolozane/1 g tazobactam] every 8 h) or meropenem (1 g every 8 h). Participants failing prior antibacterial therapy for the current HABP/VABP episode at study entry had lower 28-day all-cause mortality (ACM) rates with ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem treatment. Here, we report a post hoc analysis examining this result. METHODS: The phase 3, randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter, noninferiority trial compared ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem for treatment of adults with ventilated HABP/VABP; eligibility included those failing prior antibacterial therapy for the current HABP/VABP episode at study entry. The primary and key secondary endpoints were 28-day ACM and clinical response at test of cure (TOC), respectively. Participants who were failing prior therapy were a prospectively defined subgroup; however, subgroup analyses were not designed for noninferiority testing. The 95% CIs for treatment differences were calculated as unstratified Newcombe CIs. Post hoc analyses were performed using multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine the impact of baseline characteristics and treatment on clinical outcomes in the subgroup who were failing prior antibacterial therapy. RESULTS: In the ASPECT-NP trial, 12.8% of participants (93/726; ceftolozane/tazobactam, n = 53; meropenem, n = 40) were failing prior antibacterial therapy at study entry. In this subgroup, 28-day ACM was higher in participants who received meropenem versus ceftolozane/tazobactam (18/40 [45.0%] vs 12/53 [22.6%]; percentage difference [95% CI]: 22.4% [3.1 to 40.1]). Rates of clinical response at TOC were 26/53 [49.1%] for ceftolozane/tazobactam versus 15/40 [37.5%] for meropenem (percentage difference [95% CI]: 11.6% [- 8.6 to 30.2]). Multivariable regression analysis determined concomitant vasopressor use and treatment with meropenem were significant factors associated with risk of 28-day ACM. Adjusting for vasopressor use, the risk of dying after treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam was approximately one-fourth the risk of dying after treatment with meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: This post hoc analysis further supports the previously demonstrated lower ACM rate for ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem among participants who were failing prior therapy, despite the lack of significant differences in clinical cure rates.

Anti-leukemia immune response can be inhibited by various mechanisms leading to immune evasion and disease relapse. Selected markers of immune escape were analyzed on AML cells from leukapheresis at diagnosis (N = 53). Hierarchical clustering of AML immunophenotypes yielded distinct genetic clusters. In the absence of DNMT3A mutation, NPM1 mutation was associated with decreased HLA expression and low levels of other markers (CLIP, PD-L1, TIM-3). Analysis of an independent cohort confirmed decreased levels of HLA transcripts in patients with NPM1 mutation. Samples with combined NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations had high CLIP surface amount suggesting reduced antigen presentation. TIM-3 transcript correlated not only with TIM-3 surface protein but also with CLIP and PD-L1. In our cohort, high levels of TIM-3/PD-L1/CLIP were associated with lower survival. Our results suggest that AML genotype is related to blast immunophenotype, and that high TIM-3 transcript levels in AML blasts could be a marker of immune escape.

The BRAT1 has been identified to be the disease-causing gene for RMFSL. This study aimed to determine the underlying pathogenic mutations of a Chinese family with RMFSL and to confirm the effect of the splice-site mutation by reverse transcription analysis. METHODS: Detailed family history and clinical data were recorded, and peripheral blood samples were collected from all available family members. Whole exome sequencing (WES), Sanger sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis were performed to investigate the causative variants. The impact of the intronic variant on splicing was subsequently analyzed by RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: We identified two compound heterozygous variants in the BRAT1, c.431-2A>G in intron 3 and c.1359_1361del(p.Leu454del) in exon 9 in the proband, one inherited from each parent. Furthermore, the 3'-splice site acceptor (c.431-2A>G) variant was found to activate a cryptic acceptor splice site, which resulted in the loss of 29 nucleotides and generation of a premature stop codon at code 180, producing a truncated BRAT1 (c.432_460del; p.Ala145Argfs*36). CONCLUSIONS: This research identified two mutations in the BRAT1 of one Chinese family with RMFSL.

Numerous studies have identified Rb-dependent RNA signatures, but the proteomic effects of Rb loss are largely unexplored. We acutely ablated Rb in adult mice and conducted a quantitative analysis of RNA and proteomic changes in the colon and lungs, where Rb(KO) was sufficient or insufficient to induce ectopic proliferation, respectively. As expected, Rb(KO) caused similar increases in classic pRb/E2F-regulated transcripts in both tissues, but, unexpectedly, their protein products increased only in the colon, consistent with its increased proliferative index. Thus, these protein changes induced by Rb loss are coupled with proliferation but uncoupled from transcription. The proteomic changes in common between Rb(KO) tissues showed a striking decrease in proteins with mitochondrial functions. Accordingly, RB1 inactivation in human cells decreased both mitochondrial mass and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) function. RB(KO) cells showed decreased mitochondrial respiratory capacity and the accumulation of hypopolarized mitochondria. Additionally, RB/Rb loss altered mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation from (13)C-glucose through the TCA cycle in mouse tissues and cultured cells. Consequently, RB(KO) cells have an enhanced sensitivity to mitochondrial stress conditions. In summary, proteomic analyses provide a new perspective on Rb/RB1 mutation, highlighting the importance of pRb for mitochondrial function and suggesting vulnerabilities for treatment.", "pmid": "26314710"}

Here, we report a novel ligand- and autophosphorylation-independent activation of MET through the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase feline sarcoma-related (FER). We demonstrated that the levels of FER were elevated in ovarian cancer cell lines relative to those in immortalized normal surface epithelial cells and that suppression of FER attenuated the motility and invasive properties of these cancer cells. Furthermore, loss of FER impaired the metastasis of ovarian cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that FER phosphorylated a signaling site in MET: Tyr1349. This enhanced activation of RAC1/PAK1 and promoted a kinase-independent scaffolding function that led to recruitment and phosphorylation of GAB1 and the specific activation of the SHP2-ERK signaling pathway. Overall, this analysis provides new insights into signaling events that underlie metastasis in ovarian cancer cells, consistent with a prometastatic role of FER and highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic target for metastatic ovarian cancer.", "pmid": "27401557"}

The final and crucial step in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide is the addition of a species-dependent O-antigen to the lipid A core oligosaccharide, which is catalysed by the O-antigen ligase WaaL2. Here we present structures of WaaL from Cupriavidus metallidurans, both in the apo state and in complex with its lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The structures reveal that WaaL comprises 12 transmembrane helices and a predominantly alpha-helical periplasmic region, which we show contains many of the conserved residues that are required for catalysis. We observe a conserved fold within the GT-C family of glycosyltransferases and hypothesize that they have a common mechanism for shuttling the undecaprenyl-based carrier to and from the active site. The structures, combined with genetic, biochemical, bioinformatics and molecular dynamics simulation experiments, offer molecular details on how the ligands come in apposition, and allows us to propose a mechanistic model for catalysis. Together, our work provides a structural basis for lipopolysaccharide maturation in a member of the GT-C superfamily of glycosyltransferases.", "pmid": "35388216"}

Here, we explored IL-32 isoform expression in the colon of people with HIV (PWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and IL-32 triggers/modulators in IEC. DESIGN: Sigmoid colon biopsies (SCB) and blood were collected from ART-treated PWH (HIV + ART; n = 17; mean age: 56 years; CD4+ cell counts: 679 cells/mul; time on ART: 72 months) and age-matched HIV-uninfected controls (HIVneg; n = 5). The IEC line HT-29 was used for mechanistic studies. METHODS: Cells from SCB and blood were isolated by enzymatic digestion and/or gradient centrifugation. HT-29 cells were exposed to TLR1-9 agonists, TNF-alpha, IL-17A and HIV. IL-32alpha/beta/gamma/D/epsilon/theta and IL-17A mRNA levels were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. IL-32 protein levels were quantified by ELISA. RESULTS: IL-32beta/gamma/epsilon isoform transcripts were detectable in the blood and SCB, with IL-32beta mRNA levels being predominantly expressed in both compartments and at significantly higher levels in HIV + ART compared to HIVneg. IL-17A transcripts were only detectable in SCB, with increased IL-17A levels in HIVneg compared with HIV + ART and negatively correlated with IL-32beta mRNA levels. IL-32beta/gamma/epsilon isoform mRNA were detected in HT-29 cells upon exposure to TNF-alpha, Poly I:C (TLR3 agonist), Flagellin (TLR-5 agonist) and HIV. IL-17A significantly decreased both IL-32 beta/gamma/epsilon mRNA and cell-associated IL-32 protein levels induced upon TNF-alpha and Poly I:C triggering. CONCLUSION: We document IL-32 isoforms abundant in the colon of ART-treated PWH and reveal the capacity of the Th17 hallmark cytokine IL-17A to attenuate IL-32 overexpression in a model of inflamed IEC.", "pmid": "34101628"}

This study aimed to evaluate the function and the underlying molecular mechanism of itaconate in PD. PD models were established in vivo and in vitro using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), respectively. Pole and rotarod tests were applied to evaluate the motor coordination of mice. The expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in MPTP-induced mice and the MPP+ revulsive PD cell model were detected using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. The inflammatory factors level was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The content of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in substantia nigra, striatum, and SH-SY5Y cells were analyzed. Moreover, the apoptosis of MPP+ revulsive SH-SY5Y cells was determined using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and flow cytometry. The expression of apoptosis- and Nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-associated proteins was measured using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Itaconate attenuated motor deficits of MPTP-induced PD mice. Itaconate inhibited dopamine neuronal damage, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and neuronal apoptosis in MPTP-caused PD mice and the MPP+ revulsive PD cell model. Additionally, itaconate notably repressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. This research demonstrated that itaconate could attenuate neuroinflammation and exert dopamine neuroprotection in PD through inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome.", "pmid": "36138991"}

Rapamycin, a lipophilic macrolide antibiotic, has recently shown to be effective in the treatment of human lupus erythematosus. However, how rapamycin inhibits BAFF-stimulated B-cell proliferation and survival has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that rapamycin inhibited human soluble BAFF (hsBAFF)-induced cell proliferation and survival in normal and B-lymphoid (Raji and Daudi) cells by activation of PP2A and inactivation of Erk1/2. Pretreatment with PD98059, down-regulation of Erk1/2, expression of dominant negative MKK1, or overexpression of wild-type PP2A potentiated rapamycin's suppression of hsBAFF-activated Erk1/2 and B-cell proliferation/viability, whereas expression of constitutively active MKK1, inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid, or expression of dominant negative PP2A attenuated the inhibitory effects of rapamycin. Furthermore, expression of a rapamycin-resistant and kinase-active mTOR (mTOR-T), but not a rapamycin-resistant and kinase-dead mTOR-T (mTOR-TE), conferred resistance to rapamycin's effects on PP2A, Erk1/2 and B-cell proliferation/viability, implying mTOR-dependent mechanism involved. The findings indicate that rapamycin inhibits BAFF-stimulated cell proliferation/survival by targeting mTOR-mediated PP2A-Erk1/2 signaling pathway in normal and neoplastic B-lymphoid cells.

Hypodontia, or the absence of one or more teeth during tooth formation, is a highly prevalent dental anomaly. Nevertheless, the main causes are still unknown. Mutations in PAX9, MSX1, WNT10A, and AXIN2 genes are most commonly associated with non-syndromic tooth agenesis in the literature. This study investigated these candidate genes in an Iranian family with non-syndromic hypodontia and oligodontia. Methods. Peripheral blood samples of the proband and her family members were collected, and DNA extractions using the salting-out method were carried out. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing for candidate genes were performed. Results. A missense variant (rs4904210) was identified in the PAX9 gene, with one heterozygous missense variant (rs2240308) and one stop-gained variant (rs121908568) in the AXIN2 gene. Conclusion.

Several studies have shown that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increases the risk of infection with COVID-19. However, it is unknown if treatment with Vitamin D can reduce the associated risk of COVID-19 infection, which is the focus of this study. In the population of US veterans, we show that Vitamin D2 and D3 fills were associated with reductions in COVID-19 infection of 28% and 20%, respectively [(D3 Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.80, [95% CI 0.77, 0.83]), D2 HR = 0.72, [95% CI 0.65, 0.79]].

We also find that after controlling for vitamin D blood levels, veterans receiving higher dosages of Vitamin D obtained greater benefits from supplementation than veterans receiving lower dosages. Veterans with Vitamin D blood levels between 0 and 19 ng/ml exhibited the largest decrease in COVID-19 infection following supplementation. Black veterans received greater associated COVID-19 risk reductions with supplementation than White veterans.

There are two known polymorphisms in exon 11 of the DBP gene resulting in amino acid variants: GAT-->GAG substitution replaces aspartic acid by glutamic acid in codon 416; and ACG-->AAG substitution in codon 420 leads to an exchange of threonine for lysine. These DBP variants lead to differences in the affinity for 1.25(OH)2D3. Correlations between DBP alleles and type 1 diabetes have been described in different populations. Therefore, we investigated the polymorphism in codon 416 of the DBP gene for an association with autoimmune markers of type 1 diabetes. DESIGN AND METHODS: The present analysis was a case control study. 110 patients, 68 controls, and 115 first-degree relatives were genotyped for the DBP polymorphism in codon 416. DNA typing of DBP locus was performed by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (RFLP). RESULTS: The frequencies of the Asp/Glu and Glu/Glu were significantly increased in diabetic subjects with detectable IA-2 antibodies (P < 0.01). On the contrary, the DBP Glu-containing genotype was not accompanied by differences in the prevalence of GAD65 antibodies. These finding supports a role of the vitamin D endocrine system in the autoimmune process of type 1 diabetes.", "pmid": "15820770"}

For this purpose, hierarchical ternary and quaternary hybrid photocatalysts based on graphene oxide, TiO2, Ag2O, and arginine have been developed for combined CO2 capture and photocatalytic reductive conversion to methanol under visible and UV light irradiation. The material's band gap energy was estimated from the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) Tauc analysis algorithm. Structural and morphological properties of the synthesized photocatalysts were studied using various analytical techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The calculated band gaps for GO-TiO2-Ag2O and GO-TiO2-Ag2O-Arg were 3.18 and 2.62 eV, respectively. This reduction in the band gap showed that GO-TiO2-Ag2O-Arg has a significant visible light photocatalytic ability. The investigation of CO2 capture for the designed catalyst showed that GO-TiO2-Ag2O-Arg and GO-TiO2-Ag2O have high CO2 absorption capacities (1250 and 1185 mmol g-1, respectively, at 10 bar and 273 K under visible light irradiation). The amounts of methanol produced by GO-TiO2-Ag2O and GO-TiO2-Ag2O-Arg were 8.154 and 5.1 mumol gcat1 h-1 respectively. The main advantages of this study are the high efficiencies and selectivity of catalysts toward methanol formation. The reaction mechanism to understand the role of hybrid photocatalysts for CO2 conversion is deliberated. In addition, these catalysts remain stable during the photocatalytic process and can be used repeatedly, proving to be enlightening for environmental research.", "pmid": "36743052"}

While active cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) support tumor initiation and progression, quiescent breast stromal fibroblasts (BSFs) inhibit these effects through various cytokines such as osteoprotegerin (OPG). We showed here that OPG is upregulated in CAFs as compared to their adjacent normal tumor counterpart fibroblasts. Interestingly, breast cancer cells can upregulate OPG in BSFs in an IL-6-dependent manner through the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. When upregulated by ectopic expression, OPG activated BSFs through the NF-kappaB/STAT3/AUF1 signaling pathway and promoted their paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects in an IL-6-dependent manner. In addition, this increase in the OPG level enhanced the potential of BSFs to promote the growth of humanized orthotopic tumors in mice. However, specific OPG knock-down suppressed active CAFs and their paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects. Similar effects were observed when CAF cells were exposed to the pure recombinant OPG (rOPG) protein. Together, these findings show the importance of OPG in the activation of stromal fibroblasts and the possible use of rOPG or inhibitors of the endogenous protein to target CAFs as precision cancer therapeutics.", "pmid": "36359766"}

METHODS: Four types of demineralized bone sheets mixed with allogeneic bone in the presence or absence of bone proteins were created. Transplantation experiments using each demineralized bone sheet were performed in rats, and their ability to induce bone augmentation was analysed by microcomputed tomography images. Bioactive substances in bone proteins were isolated by heparin affinity chromatography and detected by the measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity in human periodontal ligament cells and dual luciferase assays. Noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) coexisting with the bioactive substances were identified by mass spectrometry, and their interaction with bioactive substances was investigated by in vitro binding experiments. RESULTS: Demineralized bone sheets containing bone proteins possessed the ability to induce bone augmentation. Bone proteins were isolated into five fractions by heparin affinity chromatography, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was detected in the third fraction (Hep-c). Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE), and biglycan (BGN) also coexisted in Hep-c, and the binding of these proteins to TGF-beta increased TGF-beta activity by approximately 14.7% to 32.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Demineralized bone sheets are capable of inducing bone augmentation, and this ability is mainly due to TGF-beta in the bone protein mixed with the sheets.

{"abstract_id": "886", "title": "Protein Kinase C Involvement in Neuroprotective Effects of Thymol and Carvacrol Against Toxicity Induced by Amyloid-beta in Rat Hippocampal Neurons.", "abstract": "Introduction: We have reported that thymol and carvacrol can improve cognitive abilities in Alzheimer Disease (AD) rat models. However, the mechanism of their action is not yet fully understood. Recently, our in vitro results suggested that PC12 cell death induced by Abeta25-35 can be protected by thymol and carvacrol via Protein Kinase C (PKC) and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) pathways. So, we hypothesize that the mechanisms of thymol and carvacrol in improving the learning impairment in the AD rat model may be related to their effects on PKC. So, the activity of PKC and protein expression levels of PKCalpha were examined in the hippocampal cells of the AD rat model. Methods: To examine the thymol and carvacrol effects, we performed a behavioral test in AD rat models induced by Abeta25-35 neurotoxicity. To access the underlying mechanism of the protective effects, western blotting was performed with antibodies against PKCalpha. We also measured the PKC activity assay by Elisa. Histopathological studies were carried out in the hippocampus with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. Results: The escape latency increased in Abeta-received rats compared to the control group, and thymol and carvacrol reversed this deficit. Furthermore, these compounds could enhance the PKC activity and increase the PKCalpha expression ratio. Moreover, H&E staining showed that Abeta caused shrinkage of the CA1 pyramidal neurons. However, thymol and carvacrol treatments could prevent this effect of Abeta peptides. Conclusion: This study suggests that Amyloid-Beta (Abeta) results in memory decline and histochemical disturbances in the hippocampus. Moreover, these results revealed that thymol and carvacrol could have protective effects on cognition in AD-like models via PKC activation. Highlights: Rat's ability to find the invisible platform in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) was impaired by Amyloid-Beta (Abeta) infusion in the hippocampus, while this effect was reversed by thymol or carvacrol administration.Abeta significantly downregulated the Protein Kinase C (PKC) activity in rats' hippocampus.Western blot analysis demonstrated that Abeta significantly reduced PKCalpha protein expression in AD rat model hippocampal cells.The expression ratio of PKCalpha was upregulated following the injection of thymol and carvacrol in rats.Injection of Abeta in the hippocampus resulted in histochemical disturbances in CA1 pyramidal neurons.Carvacrol and thymol can prevent several histological changes induced by Abeta. Plain Language Summary: Alzheimer's disease is one of the most important brain diseases in which the learning and memory are impaired. One of the main causes of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of amyloid beta plaques in the neurons. Protein kinase C enzyme reduces amyloid production and accumulation in the brain. In the present study, we tested the possible effects of carvacrol and thymol in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. Memory impairment was induced in adult rats by intra-cerebral infusion of amyloid beta. One week later, the memory-impaired animals were treated with carvacrol and thymol. Finally, we tested their memory in a Morris water maze apparatus. Furthermore, their hippocampus was dissected and PKC activity and the neuronal injury was evaluated. Our findings exhibited that thymol and carvacrol improved rats' memory performance. In addition, thymol and carvacrol significantly increased PKC activity and prevented neuronal cell loss in the rat hippocampus. This study shows that thymol and carvacrol have beneficial effects on memory and cognitive function via PKC activation.", "pmid": "36457884"}

They modulate the activity of two master transcription factors that control cholesterol homeostatic responses, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) and liver X receptor (LXR). Although the role of exogenous oxysterols in regulating these transcription factors has been well established, whether endogenously synthesized oxysterols similarly control both SREBP-2 and LXR remains poorly explored. Here, we carefully validate the role of oxysterols enzymatically synthesized within cells in cholesterol homeostatic responses. We first show that SREBP-2 responds more sensitively to exogenous oxysterols than LXR in Chinese hamster ovary cells and rat primary hepatocytes. We then show that 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), 27-hydroxycholesterol, and 24S-hydroxycholesterol endogenously synthesized by CH25H, CYP27A1, and CYP46A1, respectively, suppress SREBP-2 activity at different degrees by stabilizing Insig (insulin-induced gene) proteins, whereas 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol has little impact on SREBP-2. These results demonstrate the role of site-specific hydroxylation of endogenous oxysterols. In contrast, the expression of CH25H, CYP46A1, CYP27A1, or CYP7A1 fails to induce LXR target gene expression. We also show the 25-HC production-dependent suppression of SREBP-2 using a tetracycline-inducible CH25H expression system. To induce 25-HC production physiologically, murine macrophages are stimulated with a Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, and its effect on SREBP-2 and LXR is examined. The results also suggest that de novo synthesis of 25-HC preferentially regulates SREBP-2 activity. Finally, we quantitatively determine the specificity of the four cholesterol hydroxylases in living cells. Based on our current findings, we conclude that endogenous side-chain oxysterols primarily regulate the activity of SREBP-2, not LXR.", "pmid": "36423680"}

Most patients present with proliferation in the lymph nodes manifesting as adenopathy; however, RDD may primarily arise in a variety of extranodal sites, including the bone, which is a great challenge in the diagnosis. The clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic features of primary intraosseous RDD have not been well characterized. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathologic and prognostic features of four cases of primary intraosseous RDD during the past 10 years in our hospital, with a review of an additional 62 cases with complete follow-up data from the literature. Results: Primary intraosseous RDD was identified in 0.14% (4/2,800) of total bone biopsies performed at our institution over the study period. According to our retrospective analysis, a total of 18 cases of primary lymph node, skin, or other non-osseous site-based RDD were diagnosed in our hospital. The ages of the 66 total patients ranged from 1.5 to 76 years, with a median age of 25 years. There were 31 male and 35 female patients, with a male-to-female ratio of 0.89:1. Primary intraosseous RDD occurred most often in the bones of the extremities (60.6%, 40/66), with the proximal tibia being the most common location; 39.4% (26/66) of the cases arose in the axial skeleton, predominantly in the vertebra and craniofacial bones. Solitary masses and multiple tumors were present in 84.8% (56/66) and 15.2% (10/66) of the cases, respectively. Pain of the affected area was the most common presenting symptom. Radiographically, the lesions were lytic with well-defined and usually sclerotic margins. Immunohistochemistry showed that large histiocytes from patients with RDD were positive for OCT2, in addition to S100 and CD68. Molecular tests were performed in seven reported cases and four of our cases. All the 11 cases were non-decalcified. PCR results showed that there were no BRAF-V600E, KRAS, or NRAS mutations in primary intraosseous RDD; only one case with both RDD and Langerhans cell histiocytosis showed BRAF-V600E mutation. The survival data showed that 22.7% (15/66) of the patients experienced recurrences or developed RDD at distant sites during the follow-up period (median follow-up, 13 months; range, 1-106 months). The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) of the patients with primary intraosseous RDD was 57.5%. We found that there was a significant difference in PFS between female and male patients (p = 0.031). However, there was no statistically significant difference in PFS between patients with solitary masses and multiple tumors (p = 0.698). Similarly, no statistically significant differences in PFS were found between the different age groups (p = 0.908) or tumor locations (p = 0.728). Conclusion: Primary intraosseous RDD is an extremely rare disease. The diagnosis of RDD may be quite challenging because of its non-specific clinical presentation and imaging. Immunohistochemistry showed that large histiocytes were positive for OCT2 in addition to S100 and CD68, which may be helpful for differential diagnosis. Molecular detection showed that RDD may be related to the MAPK pathway, though these results are also ultimately not specific. The pathogenesis of RDD is yet to be elucidated, but recent studies suggest possible clonality of hyperproliferative histiocytes.", "pmid": "36185213"}

We conducted this retrospective study to provide an overview on clinical characteristics of ICI resistance, optimal treatment beyond disease progression after prior exposure to immunotherapy, as well as potential prognostic factors of such resistance. Methods: 190 patients diagnosed with unresectable lung cancer who received at least one administration of an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1(PD-L1) at any treatment line at Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University between Sep 2017 and December 2019 were enrolled in our study. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. Levels of plasma cytokines were evaluated for the prognostic value of ICI resistance. Results: We found that EGFR/ALK/ROS1 mutation and receiving ICI treatment as second-line therapy were risk factors associated with ICI resistance. Patients with bone metastasis at baseline had a significantly shorter PFS1 time when receiving initial ICI treatment. Whether or not patients with oligo-progression received local treatment seemed to have no significant effect on PFS2 time. Systemic therapies including chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy rather than continued immunotherapy beyond ICI resistance had significant effect on PFS2 time. TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly elevated when ICI resistance. Lower plasma TNF level and higher plasma IL-8 level seemed to be significantly associated with ICI resistance. A nomogram was established to prognosis the clinical outcome of patients treated with ICIs. Conclusion: Patients with EGFR/ALK/ROS1 mutation, or those receiving ICI treatment as second-line therapy had higher risk of ICI resistance. Patients with bone metastasis had poor prognosis during immunotherapy. For those patients with oligo-progression after ICI resistance, combination with local treatment did not lead to a significantly longer PFS2 time. Chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy rather than continued immunotherapy beyond ICI resistance had significant effect on PFS2 time. Levels of plasma cytokines including TNF, IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with ICI resistance.", "pmid": "36776868"}

Because anti-tuberculous drugs do not have a role in bone formation, a combination drug therapy with a bone anabolic agent could help in fracture prevention and promote bone reconstruction. This study aimed to investigate the influence of teriparatide on the effect of anti-tuberculous drugs in tuberculous spondylitis treatment. We used the virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Rv strain. First, we investigated the interaction between teriparatide and anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid and rifampin) by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against H37Rv. Second, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of anti-tuberculosis drugs and teriparatide on our previously developed in vitro tuberculous spondylitis model of an Mtb-infected MG-63 osteoblastic cell line using acid-fast bacilli staining and colony-forming unit counts. Selected chemokines (interleukin [IL]-8, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 kDa [IP-10], monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1, and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted [RANTES]) and osteoblast proliferation (alkaline phosphatase [ALP] and alizarin red S [ARS] staining) were measured. Teriparatide did not affect the MIC of isoniazid and rifampin. In the Mtb-infected MG-63 spondylitis model, isoniazid and rifampin treatment significantly reduced Mtb growth, and cotreatment with teriparatide did not change the anti-tuberculosis effect of isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RFP). IP-10 and RANTES levels were significantly increased by Mtb infection, whereas teriparatide did not affect all chemokine levels as inflammatory markers. ALP and ARS staining indicated that teriparatide promoted osteoblastic function even with Mtb infection. Cotreatment with teriparatide and the anti-tuberculosis drugs activated bone formation (ALP-positive area increased by 705%, P = 0.0031). Teriparatide was effective against Mtb-infected MG63 cells without the anti-tuberculosis drugs (ARS-positive area increased by 326%, P = 0.0037). Teriparatide had no effect on the efficacy of anti-tuberculosis drugs and no adverse effect on the activity of Mtb infection in osteoblasts. Furthermore, regulation of representative osteoblastic inflammatory chemokines was not changed by teriparatide treatment. In the in vitro Mtb-infected MG-63 cell model of tuberculous spondylitis, cotreatment with the anti-tuberculosis drugs and teriparatide increased osteoblastic function.", "pmid": "36522387"}

Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, is currently indicated as first-line therapy in patients with NSCLC with sensitizing EGFR mutations, as second-line therapy in patients who present the resistance-associated mutation T790M after treatment with previous EGFR-TKIs, and as adjuvant therapy for patients with early stage resected NSCLC, harboring EGFR mutations. Despite durable responses in patients with advanced NSCLC, resistance to osimertinib, similar to other targeted therapies, inevitably develops. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance, including both EGFR-dependent and -independent molecular pathways, as well as their therapeutic potential, represents an unmet need in thoracic oncology. Interestingly, differential resistance mechanisms develop when osimertinib is administered in a first-line versus second-line setting, indicating the importance of selection pressure and clonal evolution of tumor cells. Standard therapeutic approaches after progression to osimertinib include other targeted therapies, when a targetable genetic alteration is detected, and cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without antiangiogenic and immunotherapeutic agents. Deciphering the when and how to use immunotherapeutic agents in EGFR-positive NSCLC is a current challenge in clinical lung cancer research. Emerging treatment options after progression to osimertinib involve combinations of different therapeutic approaches and novel EGFR-TKI inhibitors. Research should also be focused on the standardization of liquid biopsies in order to facilitate the monitoring of molecular alterations after progression to osimertinib.", "pmid": "36765799"}

It is a natural functional food rich in many bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, saponins and phytosterols. Several studies have demonstrated that the consumption of lentils is potentially important in reducing the incidence of a number of chronic diseases, due to their bioactive compounds. The most common polyphenols in lentils include phenolic acids, flavan-3-ol, flavonols, anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins, and anthocyanins, which play an important role in the prevention of several degenerative diseases in humans, due to their antioxidant activity. Furthermore, lentil polyphenols are reported to have antidiabetic, cardioprotective and anticancer activities. Lentil saponins are triterpene glycosides, mainly soyasaponins I and betag. These saponins have a plasma cholesterol-lowering effect in humans and are important in reducing the risk of many chronic diseases. Moreover, high levels of phytosterols have been reported in lentils, especially in the seed coat, and beta-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol are the most abundant. Beyond their hypocholesterolemic effect, phytosterols in lentils are known for their anti-inflammatory activity. In this review, the current information on the nutritional composition, bioactive compounds including polyphenols, saponins and phytosterols, and their associated health-promoting effects are discussed.", "pmid": "36297337"}

However, the molecular mechanisms of how IDH2 mutations induce carcinogenesis remain unclear. Using overlapping PCR, transfection, immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, measurements of enzyme activity, glucose, lactic acid, ATP, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell viability, protein degradation assays post-inhibition of the 26S proteasome (bortezomib) or HSP90 (17-AAG), and a homology model, we demonstrated that the properties of ten cancer-associated IDH2 variants (R140G/Q/W and R172S/K/M/W/G/C/P) arising from point mutations are closely related to their structure and stability. Compared with wild-type IDH2, the R172 and R140 point mutations resulted in a decrease in IDH2 activity, ROS, and lactate levels and an increase in glucose and ATP levels under normal and hypoxic conditions, indicating that mutant IDH2 increases cell dependency on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and reduces glycolysis under hypoxia. Overexpression of most of IDH2 point mutants showed anti-proliferative effects in the 293T and BV2 cell lines by inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling and cyclin D1 expression and/or induced the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6. Furthermore, bortezomib treatment resulted in dramatic degradation of IDH2 mutants, including R140G, R140Q, R140W, R172S and R172K, whereas it had little impact on the expression of WT and other mutants (R172M, R172W, R172G, R172C and R172P). In addition, targeting HSP90 minimally affected the expression of mutated IDH2 due to a lack of interaction between HSP90 and IDH2. The homology model further revealed that changes in conformation and IDH2 protein stability appeared to be associated with these point mutations.

The fine control of cellular metabolism underlying DC immune tolerance remains elusive. We have recently reported that NCoR1 ablation generates immune-tolerant DCs through enhanced IL-10, IL-27 and SOCS3 expression. In this study, we did comprehensive metabolic profiling of these tolerogenic DCs and identified that they meet their energy requirements through enhanced glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), supported by fatty acid oxidation-driven oxygen consumption. In addition, the reduced pyruvate and glutamine oxidation with a broken TCA cycle maintains the tolerogenic state of the cells. Mechanistically, the AKT-mTOR-HIF-1alpha-axis mediated glycolysis and CPT1a-driven beta-oxidation were enhanced in these tolerogenic DCs. To confirm these observations, we used synthetic metabolic inhibitors and found that the combined inhibition of HIF-1alpha and CPT1a using KC7F2 and etomoxir, respectively, compromised the overall transcriptional signature of immunological tolerance including the regulatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-27. Functionally, treatment of tolerogenic DCs with dual KC7F2 and etomoxir treatment perturbed the polarization of co-cultured naive CD4+ T helper (Th) cells towards Th1 than Tregs, ex vivo and in vivo. Physiologically, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection model depicted significantly reduced bacterial burden in BMcDC1 ex vivo and in CD103+ lung DCs in Mtb infected NCoR1DC-/-mice. The spleen of these infected animals also showed increased Th1-mediated responses in the inhibitor-treated group. These findings suggested strong involvement of NCoR1 in immune tolerance. Our validation in primary human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) showed diminished NCOR1 expression in dexamethasone-derived tolerogenic moDCs along with suppression of CD4+T cell proliferation and Th1 polarization. Furthermore, the combined KC7F2 and etomoxir treatment rescued the decreased T cell proliferative capacity and the Th1 phenotype. Overall, for the first time, we demonstrated here that NCoR1 mediated control of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation fine-tunes immune tolerance versus inflammation balance in murine and human DCs.", "pmid": "36565644"}

CFI-400945 is a novel, highly effective anticancer drug that inhibits polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) and targets mitosis. In this study, we aim to investigate how CFI-400945 affects the development of proliferative vascular diseases. In C57BL/6 mice, neointima formation was generated by complete carotid ligation. In apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet, atherosclerosis was induced by partial carotid ligation. CFI-400945 was directly applied to carotid arteries via a perivascular collar. Our results showed that CFI-400945 drastically inhibited neointima formation but significantly accelerated atherosclerosis. In vitro studies showed that CFI-400945 treatment induced SMC polyploidization and arrested cells in the G2/M phase. CFI-400945 treatment upregulated p53 and p27 expression but decreased p21 and cyclin B1 expression. CFI-400945 also induced SMC apoptosis, which was inhibited by hydroxyurea, a DNA synthesis inhibitor that inhibits polyploidization. Furthermore, CFI-400945 caused supernumerary centrosomes, leading to mitotic failure, resulting in polyploidization. In conclusion, CFI-400945 prevents carotid arterial neointima formation in C57BL/6 mice but accelerates atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice, likely through mitotic arrest and subsequent induction of polyploidization and apoptosis.", "pmid": "36750553"}

METHOD: Six Databases were consulted a) Micromedex drug interaction b) Medicine complete.com c) Liverpool Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies d) Epocrates e) Medscape f) drugs.com. To acquire information on possible interaction effects between drugs used for COVID-19 treatment such as atazanavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, paxlovid(nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), dexamethasone, azithromycin, chloroquine, and FDA approved monoclonal antibodies with primarily used antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, and drugs acting on the cardiovascular system. RESULTS: Potential interaction effects such as worsening glycemic control were prominent with lopinavir/ritonavir and the primarily used antidiabetic drugs, which needs dosage adjustment and close monitoring. The risk of hypotension and irregular heart rhythm is the potential interaction effects with concomitant use of drugs for COVID-19 treatment and antihypertensive drugs. Caution is advised with drugs such as atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir when concomitantly used in treating comorbid conditions. Drugs such as remdesivir, molnupiravir, and some monoclonal antibodies are safer in use with drugs used in treating the comorbid condition.

This provides opportunities for early diagnosis, but also fuels uncertainty in variant carriers (G+), since disease penetrance is incomplete. We assessed the prevalence and disease expression of G+ in the general population. METHODS: We identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants associated with ARVC, DCM and/or HCM in 200 643 UK Biobank individuals, who underwent whole exome sequencing. We calculated the prevalence of G+ and analyzed the frequency of cardiomyopathy/heart failure diagnosis. In undiagnosed individuals, we analyzed early signs of disease expression using available electrocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging data. RESULTS: We found a prevalence of 1:578, 1:251, and 1:149 for pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants associated with ARVC, DCM and HCM respectively. Compared with controls, cardiovascular mortality was higher in DCM G+ (odds ratio 1.67 [95% CI 1.04; 2.59], P=0.030), but similar in ARVC and HCM G+ (P>=0.100). Cardiomyopathy or heart failure diagnosis were more frequent in DCM G+ (odds ratio 3.66 [95% CI 2.24; 5.81], P=4.9x10-7) and HCM G+ (odds ratio 3.03 [95% CI 1.98; 4.56], P=5.8x10-7), but comparable in ARVC G+ (P=0.172). In contrast, ARVC G+ had more ventricular arrhythmias (P=3.3x10-4). In undiagnosed individuals, left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced in DCM G+ (P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: In the general population, pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants associated with ARVC, DCM, or HCM are not uncommon. Although G+ have increased mortality and morbidity, disease penetrance in these carriers from the general population remains low (1.2-3.1%). Follow-up decisions in case of incidental findings should not be based solely on a variant, but on multiple factors, including family history and disease expression.", "pmid": "36264615"}

The monoamine hypothesis of depression suggests that 5-HT, NE, and DA synergistically affect mood, which is the basis of current drug therapy for depression. However, histamine as a monoamine transmitter is rarely studied. Our review is the first time to illustrate the effect of histaminergic system on depression in order to find the way for the development of new antidepressant drugs. The brain neurotransmitter histamine is involved in MDD, and the brain histaminergic system operates through four receptors. Histamine and its receptors can also regulate the immune response to improve symptoms of depression. In addition, H3R can interact with other depression-related transmitters (including 5-HT, DA, GLU, and MCH); thus, histamine may participate in the occurrence of depression through other neural circuits. Notably, in rodent studies, several H3R and H1R antagonists were found to be safe and effective in alleviating depression-like behavior.

Despite the significant role attributed to transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta family and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-MET signaling in glioblastoma pathogenesis, their functional interactions have not been well characterized. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches to stimulate or antagonize the TGF-beta pathway in human glioma-initiating cells (GIC), we observed that TGF-beta exerts an inhibitory effect on c-MET phosphorylation. Inhibition of either mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) signaling pathway attenuated this effect. A comparison of c-MET-driven and c-MET independent GIC models revealed that TGF-beta inhibits stemness in GIC at least in part via its negative regulation of c-MET activity, suggesting that stem cell (SC) maintenance may be controlled by the balance between these two oncogenic pathways. Importantly, immunohistochemical analyses of human glioblastoma and ex vivo single-cell gene expression profiling of TGF-beta and HGF confirm the negative interaction between both pathways. These novel insights into the crosstalk of two major pathogenic pathways in glioblastoma may explain some of the disappointing results when targeting either pathway alone in human glioblastoma patients and inform on potential future designs on targeted pharmacological or genetic intervention.", "pmid": "29238047"}

Here, we aimed to identify the effects of saponins derived from Panax ginseng on inflammation and mucin overproduction. Methods: NCI-H292 cells were pre-incubated with 16 saponins derived from P. ginseng, and mucin overproduction was induced by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Mucin protein MUC5AC was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA levels were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Moreover, we performed a transcriptome analysis of PMA-treated NCI-H292 cells in the absence or presence of Rg5, and differential gene expression was confirmed using qPCR. Phosphorylation levels of signaling molecules, and the abundance of lipid droplets, were measured by western blotting, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. Results: Ginsenoside Rg5 effectively reduced MUC5AC secretion and decreased MUC5AC mRNA levels. A systematic functional network analysis revealed that Rg5 upregulated cholesterol and glycerolipid metabolism, resulting in the production of lipid droplets to clear reactive oxygen species (ROS), and modulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling pathways to regulate inflammatory responses. Rg5 induced the accumulation of lipid droplets and decreased cellular ROS levels, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine, a ROS inhibitor, reduced MUC5AC secretion via Rg5. Furthermore, Rg5 hampered the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 proteins, affecting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and pro-inflammatory responses.

CASE SUMMARY: A 69-year-old white female presented to the emergency department with a history of confusion and paranoia over the past several days. On admission the patient was taking carvedilol 12 mg twice daily, warfarin 2 mg/day, folic acid 1 mg/day, levothyroxine 100 microg/day, pantoprazole 40 mg/day, paroxetine 40 mg/day, and flecainide 100 mg twice daily. Flecainide had been started 2 weeks prior for atrial fibrillation. Laboratory test findings on admission were notable only for a flecainide plasma concentration of 1360 microg/L (reference range 200-1000). A metabolic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine, which the patient had been taking for more than 5 years, was considered. Paroxetine was discontinued and the dose of flecainide was reduced to 50 mg twice daily. Her delirium resolved 3 days later. DISCUSSION: Flecainide and pharmacologically similar agents that interact with sodium channels may cause delirium in susceptible patients. A MEDLINE search (1966-January 2009) revealed one in vivo pharmacokinetic study on the interaction between flecainide, a CYP2D6 substrate, and paroxetine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as well as 3 case reports of flecainide-induced delirium. According to the Naranjo probability scale, flecainide was the probable cause of the patient's delirium; the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale indicates a possible pharmacokinetic drug interaction between flecainide and paroxetine. CONCLUSIONS: Supratherapeutic flecainide plasma concentrations may cause delirium. Because toxicity may occur when flecainide is prescribed with paroxetine and other potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, flecainide plasma concentrations should be monitored closely with commencement of CYP2D6 inhibitors.", "pmid": "19531695"}

We find that ATRX binds the regulatory elements of cell-cycle phase transition genes in GBM cells, and there is a marked reduction in Checkpoint Kinase 1 (CHEK1) expression with ATRX loss, leading to the early release of G2/M entry after irradiation. ATRX-deficient cells exhibit enhanced activation of master cell-cycle regulator ATM with irradiation.

Clinical evidence demonstrates that COVID-19, by promoting the evolution of a prothrombotic state, increases the susceptibility to arrhythmic events during the infective stages and presumably during post-recovery. AF itself is the most frequent form of arrhythmia and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. One of the molecular factors involved in COVID-19-related AF episodes is the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 availability. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses ACE2 to enter and infect multiple cells. Atrial ACE2 internalization after binding to SARS-CoV-2 results in a raise of angiotensin (Ang) II, and in a suppression of cardioprotective Ang(1-7) formation, and thereby promoting cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and oxidative stress.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between plasma irisin, an adipomyokine reported to protect the functional integrity of vascular endothelium, and circulating endothelial microparticles (EMPs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), consisting early biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction, in preterm-born children. We studied 131 prepubertal children; 61 preterm and 70 born at term (controls). Plasma irisin was determined by ELISA. Circulating CD62E(+), CD144(+) and CD31(+)/CD42b(-) EMPs, and CD34(+)/VEGFR-2(+)/CD45(-) and CD34(+)/VEGFR-2(+)/CD45dim EPCs, were determined by flow cytometry. Body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, neck circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and biochemical parameters (glucose, lipids, insulin, HOMA-IR) were also evaluated. Plasma irisin was significantly lower (p = 0.001), whereas circulating EMPs and EPCs were higher, in children born prematurely compared to controls. Irisin was recognized as independent predictor for CD144(+) and CD31(+)/CD42b(-) EMPs, CD34(+)/VEGFR-2(+)/CD45(-) and CD34(+)/VEGFR-2(+)/CD45dim EPCs in the total study population, and for CD31(+)/CD42b(-) EMPs in the preterm group. In conclusion, plasma irisin correlates independently with circulating EMP and EPC subpopulations in prepubertal children and in preterm-born ones. Further studies in children will potentially elucidate the link between irisin and the primary stages of prematurity-related endothelial dysfunction.", "pmid": "36677045"}

Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) is one of the key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of dendrobine. In this work, we found the expression profiles of DnFPPS were correlated with the contents of dendrobine under the methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatments at different time. Then, the cloning and functional identification of a novel FPPS from D. nobile. The full length of DnFPPS is 1231 bp with an open reading frame of 1047 bp encoding 348 amino acids. The sequence similarity analysis demonstrated that DnFPPS was in the high homology with Dendrobium huoshanense and Dendrobium catenatum and contained four conserved domains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that DnFPPS was the close to the DhFPPS. Then, DnFPPS was induced to express in Escherichia coli, purified, and identified by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis indicated that DnFPPS could catalyze dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate to produce farnesyl diphosphate.

The miR-29s family, including miR-29a and miR-29b1 as well as miR-29b2 and miR-29c, are implicated in aging, metabolism, neuronal survival, and neurological disorders. In this study, the roles of miR-29a/b1 in aging and PD were investigated. miR-29a/b1 knockout mice (named as 29a KO hereafter) and their wild-type (WT) controls were used to analyze aging-related phenotypes. After challenged with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), dopaminergic injuries, glial activation, and mouse behaviors were evaluated. Primary glial cells were further cultured to explore the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, the levels of miR-29s in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients (n = 18) and healthy subjects (n = 17) were quantified. 29a KO mice showed dramatic weight loss, kyphosis, and along with increased and deepened wrinkles in skins, when compared with WT mice. Moreover, both abdominal and brown adipose tissues reduced in 29a KO mice, compared to their WT counterpart. However, in MPTP-induced PD mouse model, the deficiency of miR-29a/b1 led to less severe damages of dopaminergic system and mitigated glial activation in the nigrostriatal pathway, and subsequently alleviated the motor impairments in 3-month-old mice. Eight-month-old mutant mice maintained such a resistance to MPTP intoxication. Mechanistically, the deficiency of miR-29a/b-1 promoted the expression of neurotrophic factors in 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated primary mixed glia and primary astrocytes. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated primary microglia, knockout of miR-29a/b-1 inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors, and promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory factors and neurotrophic factors. Knockout of miR-29a/b1 increased the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and repressed NF-kappaB/p65 signaling in glial cells. Moreover, we found miR-29a level was increased in the CSF of patients with PD. Our results suggest that 29a KO mice display the peripheral premature senility. The combined effects of less activated glial cells might contribute to the mitigated inflammatory responses and elicit resistance to MPTP intoxication in miR-29a/b1 KO mice.", "pmid": "36277485"}

Immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi), have revolutionized cancer treatment, but their role in glioblastoma is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To review the state of immunotherapies in glioblastoma, with an emphasis on recently published ICPi clinical trials. METHODS: In this editorial/opinion article, we critically review results of the first generation of trials of ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab in glioblastoma, as well as future directions. RESULTS: Expression of PD-L1 is frequent in glioblastoma, ranging from 60-70% of patients. Phase 1 studies of nivolumab with and without ipilimumab, as well as pembrolizumab, showed no new safety concerns in brain tumors, and no neurotoxicity. However, randomized phase 3 trials of nivolumab showed no survival improvements over bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma; no role in newly diagnosed disease as a replacement for temozolomide in unmethylated MGMT promoter tumors; and no benefit as an addition to temozolomide in methylated MGMT tumors. However, studies examining post treatment tumor samples have shown signs of increased immunologic response, and occasional long lasting radiographic responses have been seen. A small study of pembrolizumab suggested a potential role as a \"neoadjuvant\" treatment in resectable recurrent glioblastoma, while other studies are investigating selection of patients with higher mutational burden and novel agents and combinatorial strategies. CONCLUSION: Despite initial negative trials, immunotherapy remains of high interest in glioblastoma, and many trials are still ongoing. Improving our mechanistic understanding of the immunosuppression and T cell dysfunction induced by both tumor and the CNS microenvironment remains however crucial for the development of successful immunotherapeutic approaches in this disease.", "pmid": "35976319"}

However, the optimal sequence, cabozantinib then nivolumab (CN) or nivolumab then cabozantinib (NC), is still unknown. The CABIR study aimed to identify the optimal sequence between CN and NC after frontline VEGFR-TKI. In this multicenter retrospective study, we collected data from mRCC pts receiving CN or NC, after frontline VEGFR-TKI. A propensity score (PrS) was calculated to manage bias selection, and sequence comparisons were carried out with a cox model on a matched sample 1:1. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) from the start of second line to progression in third line (PFS2-3 ). Key secondary endpoints included overall survival from second line (OS2 ). Out of 139 included mRCC patients, 38 (27%) and 101 (73%) received CN and NC, respectively. Overlap in PrS allowed 1:1 matching for each CN pts, with characteristics well balanced. For both PFS2-3 and OS2 , NC sequence was superior to CN (PFS2-3 : HR = 0.58 [0.34-0.98], P = .043; OS2 : 0.66 [0.42-1.05], P = .080). Superior PFS2-3 was in patients treated between 6 and 18 months with prior VEGFR-TKI (P = .019) and was driven by a higher PFSL3 with cabozantinib when given after nivolumab (P < .001). The CABIR study shows a prolonged PFS of the NC sequence compared to CN in mRCC after first line VEGFR-TKI failure. The data suggest that cabozantinib may be more effective than nivolumab in the third-line setting, possibly related to an ability of cabozantinib to overcome resistance to PD-1 blockade.", "pmid": "35603906"}

However, whether mitophagy plays a role in colon cancer remains unclear. Cirsiliol is a natural product and has been found to exert anti-cancer effects in multiple tumors. The effects of cirsiliol in the tumorigenesis and progression of colon cancer remain unknown. METHODS: CCK8 assay, plate cloning assay, and cell scratch assay were performed to determine cell viability, colony formation, and wound healing abilities of HCT116 and SW480 cells. JC-1 staining, H2DCFDA staining, and Mito-Tracker Red staining were carried out to evaluate mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and mitochondrial morphology. Molecular docking technology was utilized to predict interaction of cirsiliol and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Immunofluorescence staining was used to measure nuclear translocation of STAT3. The protein levels of phosphorylated STAT3 (Y705), total STAT3, and mitophagy proteins were detected by western blot. RESULTS: In this study, we first found that cirsiliol inhibited cell viability, colony formation, and wound healing abilities of HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cells. Moreover, cirsiliol suppressed Deltapsim, increased ROS production, and disrupted mitochondrial morphology via inhibiting the levels of mitophagy proteins including PINK1, Parkin, BNIP3, and FUNDC1. Application of mitophagy activator improved the levels of mitophagy-related proteins, and ameliorated Deltapsim and ROS levels. According to the result of molecular docking, we found that cirsiliol potentially bound to the SH2 domain of STAT3, the key domain for the functional activation of STAT3. Moreover, it was found that cirsiliol inhibited constitutive and IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. Comparing with cirsiliol group, we found that overexpression of STAT3 restored the expressions of mitophagy proteins.

Recently, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) and resulting portal hypertension have been reported as important side effects of oxaliplatin. We herein report a rectal cancer patient who underwent percutaneous transhepatic stoma variceal embolization (PTO) and partial splenic artery embolization (PSE) for stomal variceal bleeding and splenomegaly due to portal hypertension caused by SOS after CAPOX therapy.

Inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission plays a vital role in controlling learning, memory and synaptic plasticity. Since early-life inflammation has been reported to adversely affect the GABAergic synaptic transmission, the aim of this study was to investigate whether and how neonatal inflammation affects GABAergic synaptic transmission resulting in cognitive impairment. Neonatal mice received a daily subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 mug/kg) or saline on postnatal days 3-5. It was found that blocking GABAergic synaptic transmission reversed the deficit in hippocampus-dependent memory or the induction failure of long-term potentiation in the dorsal CA1 in adult LPS mice. An increase of mIPSCs amplitude was further detected in adult LPS mice indicative of postsynaptic potentiation of GABAergic transmission. Additionally, neonatal LPS resulted in the increased expression and function of K+-Cl--cotransporter 2 (KCC2) and the decreased expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) in the dorsal CA1 during adulthood. The local TGF-beta1 overexpression improved KCC2 expression and function, synaptic plasticity and memory of adult LPS mice. Adult LPS mice show hypermethylation of TGFb1 promoter and negatively correlate with reduced TGF-beta1 transcripts. 5-Aza-deoxycytidine restored the changes in TGFb1 promoter methylation and TGF-beta1 expression. Altogether, the results suggest that hypermethylation-induced reduction of TGF-beta1 leads to enhanced GABAergic synaptic inhibition through increased KCC2 expression, which is a underlying mechanism of neonatal inflammation-induced hippocampus-dependent memory impairment in adult mice.", "pmid": "36691035"}

In order to cure bisphenol A epoxy resin, a maleopimaric anhydride (MPA) curing agent was prepared from rosin, a renewable resource, and blended with a petroleum-based curing agent (methylhexahy-drophthalic anhydride). The influence of maleopimaric anhydride content on the initiation and growth characteristics of electrical trees was studied and analyzed in this paper using molecular dynamics simulation (MD) and electrical tree tests at an 18-kilovolt power frequency voltage. When the MPA content used was <=10%, the free volume percentage of the curing system increased with MPA content, and thus the initiation voltage became lower; when the MPA content was >=20%, the hydrogenated phenanthrene ring structure content increased significantly with increasing MPA content, and the rigidity of the curing system increased significantly; thus, the initiation voltage gradually increased. MPA4 had an 11.11% higher initiation voltage than the petroleum-based control group. The effect of the polar rigid structure within the curing system significantly inhibited the growth rate and length of electrical trees as MPA content increased. Electrical trees developed into light-colored, thin, and narrow dendritic structures when the MPA content reached 40%. The results show that curing epoxy resin with the rosin-based curing agent maleopimaric anhydride (MPA), in place of a petroleum-based curing agent, can produce environmentally friendly resins with excellent electrical tree resistance and potential application prospects.", "pmid": "36146010"}

B7 family is an important modulator of the immune response. However, its dysregulation and underlying molecular mechanism in UVM still remains unclear. Methods: Data were derived from TCGA and GEO databases. The prognosis was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curve. The ESTIMATE algorithm, CIBERSORT algorithm, and TIMER database were used to demonstrate the correlation between B7 family and tumor immune microenvironment in UVM. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to detect the expression levels of the B7 family in different cell types of UVM. UVM was classified into different types by consistent clustering. Enrichment analysis revealed downstream signaling pathways of the B7 family. The interaction between different cell types was visualized by cell chat. Results: The expression level of B7 family in UVM was significantly dysregulated and negatively correlated with methylation level. The expression of B7 family was associated with prognosis and immune infiltration, and B7 family plays an important role in the tumor microenvironment (TME). B7 family members were highly expressed in monocytes/macrophages of UVM compared with other cell types. Immune response and visual perception were the main functions affected by B7 family. The result of cell chat showed that the interaction between photoreceptor cells and immune-related cells was mainly generated by HLA-C-CD8A. CABP4, KCNJ10 and RORB had the strongest correlation with HLA-C-CD8A, and their high expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. CABP4 and RORB were specifically expressed in photoreceptor cells. Conclusions: Dysregulation of the B7 family in UVM is associated with poor prognosis and affects the tumor immune microenvironment. CABP4 and RORB can serve as potential therapeutic targets for UVM, which can be regulated by the B7 family to affect the visual perception and immune response function of the eye, thus influencing the prognosis of UVM.", "pmid": "36311731"}

The degradation of NMD target mRNAs involves both exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic pathways in mammalian cells. While the latter is mediated by the endonuclease SMG6, the former pathway has been reported to require a complex of SMG5-SMG7 or SMG5-PNRC2 binding to UPF1. However, the existence, dominance, and mechanistic details of these exonucleolytic pathways are divisive. Therefore, we have investigated the possible exonucleolytic modes of mRNA decay in NMD by examining the roles of UPF1, SMG5, SMG7, and PNRC2 using a combination of functional assays and interaction mapping. Confirming previous work, we detected an interaction between SMG5 and SMG7 and also a functional need for this complex in NMD. In contrast, we found no evidence for the existence of a physical or functional interaction between SMG5 and PNRC2. Instead, we show that UPF1 interacts with PNRC2 and that it triggers 5'-3' exonucleolytic decay of reporter transcripts in tethering assays. PNRC2 interacts mainly with decapping factors and its knockdown does not affect the RNA levels of NMD reporters. We conclude that PNRC2 is probably an important mRNA decapping factor but that it does not appear to be required for NMD.", "pmid": "29348139"}

The reversible binding of IGF-1 to IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 regulates the amount of bioavailable, functional IGF-1 in circulation. Cyclic glycine-proline (cGP), a metabolite from the binding site of IGF-1, retains its affinity for IGFBP-3 and competes against IGF-1 for IGFBP-3 binding. Thus, cGP and IGFBP-3 collectively regulate the bioavailability of IGF-1. The molar ratio of cGP/IGF-1 represents the amount of bioavailable and functional IGF-1 in circulation. The cGP/IGF-1 molar ratio is low in patients with age-related conditions, including hypertension, stroke, and neurological disorders with cognitive impairment. Stroke patients with a higher cGP/IGF-1 molar ratio have more favourable clinical outcomes. The elderly with more cGP have better memory retention. An increase in the cGP/IGF-1 molar ratio with age is associated with normal cognition, whereas a decrease in this ratio with age is associated with dementia in Parkinson disease. In addition, cGP administration reduces systolic blood pressure, improves memory, and aids in stroke recovery.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to report the molecular consequences of a novel splice-junction mutation and a novel missense mutation in the TSH-beta subunit gene found in two patients with congenital central hypothyroidism and conventional treatment-resistant anemia. RESULTS: Patient 1 had a homozygous G to A nucleotide change at the 5' donor splice site of exon/intron 2. This resulted in a silent change at codon 34 of the mature protein. In vitro splicing assays showed that the mutant minigene dramatically affected pre-mRNA processing, causing exon 2 to be completely skipped. The putative product from a new out-of-frame translational start point in exon 3 is expected to yield a nonsense 25-amino-acid peptide. In patient 2, sequence analysis revealed a compound heterozygosis for the already reported 313delT (C105Vfs114X) mutation and for a second novel mutation in exon 3, substituting G for A at cDNA nucleotide position 323, resulting in a C88Y change. This cysteine residue is conserved among all dimeric pituitary and placental glycoprotein hormone-beta subunits. Data from in silico analysis confirmed that the C88Y mutation would affect subunit conformation. Indeed, two different bioinformatics approaches, PolyPhen and SIFT analysis, predicted C88Y to be a damaging substitution.

Observations from humans and mouse models suggest dysregulated sulfate levels may be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism. However, the cellular mechanisms governing sulfate homeostasis within the developing or adult brain are not fully understood. METHODS: We utilized a mouse model with a conditional allele for the sulfate transporter Slc13a4, and a battery of behavioral tests, to assess the effects of disrupted sulfate transport on maternal behaviors, social interactions, memory, olfaction, exploratory behavior, anxiety, stress, and metabolism. Immunohistochemistry examined neurogenesis within the stem cells niches. FINDINGS: The sulfate transporter Slc13a4 plays a critical role in postnatal brain development. Slc13a4 haploinsufficiency results in significant behavioral phenotypes in adult mice, notably impairments in social interaction and long-term memory, as well as increased neurogenesis in the subventricular stem cell niche. Conditional gene deletion shows these phenotypes have a developmental origin, and that full biallelic expression of Slc13a4 is required only in postnatal development. Furthermore, administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) within postnatal window P14-P30 prevents the onset of phenotypes in adult Slc13a4+/- mice. INTERPRETATION: Slc13a4 haploinsufficient mice highlight a requirement for adequate sulfate supply in postnatal development for the maturation of important social interaction and memory pathways. With evidence suggesting dysregulated sulfate biology may be a feature of some neurodevelopmental disorders, the utility of sulfate levels as a biomarker of disease and NAC administration as an early preventative measure should be further explored.", "pmid": "30956169"}

Gigaxonin regulates the degradation of multiple intermediate filament (IF) proteins, including neurofilaments, GFAP, and vimentin, which aggregate in GAN patient cells. Understanding how IFs and their aggregates are processed under stress can reveal new GAN disease mechanisms and potential targets for therapy. Here we tested the hypothesis that hypotonic stress-induced vimentin proteolysis is impaired in GAN. In both GAN and control fibroblasts exposed to hypotonic stress, we observed time-dependent vimentin cleavage that resulted in two prominent ~40-45 kDa fragments. However, vimentin proteolysis occurred more rapidly and extensively in GAN cells compared to unaffected controls as both fragments were generated earlier and at 4-6-fold higher levels. To test enzymatic involvement, we determined the expression levels and localization of the calcium-sensitive calpain proteases-1 and -2 and their endogenous inhibitor calpastatin. While the latter was not affected, the expression of both calpains was 2-fold higher in GAN cells compared to control cells. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of calpains with MDL-28170 or MG-132 attenuated vimentin cleavage. Imaging analysis revealed striking colocalization between large perinuclear vimentin aggregates and calpain-2 in GAN fibroblasts. This colocalization was dramatically altered by hypotonic stress, where selective breakdown of filaments over aggregates occurred rapidly in GAN cells and coincided with calpain-2 cytoplasmic redistribution. Finally, mass spectrometry-based proteomics revealed that phosphorylation at Ser-412, located at the junction between the central \"rod\" domain and C-terminal \"tail\" domain on vimentin, is involved in this stress response. Over-expression studies using phospho-deficient and phospho-mimic mutants revealed that Ser-412 is important for filament organization, solubility dynamics, and vimentin cleavage upon hypotonic stress exposure. Collectively, our work reveals that osmotic stress induces calpain- and proteasome-mediated vimentin degradation and IF network breakdown. These effects are significantly augmented in the presence of disease-causing KLHL16 mutations that alter intermediate filament organization. While the specific roles of calpain-generated vimentin IF fragments in GAN cells remain to be defined, this proteolytic pathway is translationally-relevant to GAN because maintaining osmotic homeostasis is critical for nervous system function.", "pmid": "36393840"}

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was the most frequently abnormal (23.7%, 95% CI 15.7-33.4%), followed by the ultrasound hyperechogenicity (22%, 95% CI 14-32%), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) (17.2%, 95% CI 10.2-26.4%), smell assessment (12.4%, 95% CI 6.6-20.6%) and abnormalities in sleep questionnaires (11%, 95% CI 5.7-19.4%). Significant correlations were found between tests from different domains. To define the risk for PD, we assessed the bottom 10th percentile of each prodromal test, defining this level as \"abnormal\". Then we calculated the percentage of \"abnormal\" tests for each subject; the median (range) was 4.55 (0-43.5%). Twenty-two subjects had more than 15% \"abnormal\" tests. The limitations of the study included ascertainment bias of individuals with GBA-related PD in relatives, some incomplete data due to technical issues, and a lack of well-characterized normal value ranges in some tests. We plan to enroll additional participants and conduct longitudinal follow-up assessments to build a model for identifying individuals at risk for PD and investigate interventions aiming to delay the onset or perhaps to prevent full-blown PD.", "pmid": "36293067"}

We report a Korean having MH with multi-minicore myopathy functionally supported by RYR1-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release testing in B lymphocytes. A 14-year-old boy was admitted for the evaluation of progressive torticollis accompanied by cervicothoracic scoliosis. During the preoperative drape of the patient for the release of the sternocleidomastoid muscle under general anesthesia, his wrist and ankle were observed to have severe flexion contracture. The body temperature was 37.1  C. To treat MH, the patient was administered a bolus of dantrolene intravenously (1.5 mg/kg) and sodium bicarbonate. After a few minutes, muscle rigidity, tachycardia, and EtCO2 all resolved. Next-generation panel sequencing for hereditary myopathy identified a novel RYR1 heterozygous missense variant (NM_000540.2: c.6898T > C; p.Ser2300Pro), which mapped to the MH2 domain of the protein, a hot spot for MH mutations. Ex vivo RYR1-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release testing in B lymphocytes showed hypersensitive Ca2+ responses to isoflurane and caffeine, resulting in an abnormal Ca2+ release only in the proband, not in his family members.

TGF-beta1/Smad4 regulated collagen deposition is a hallmark of hepatic fibrosis. The potential regulation on miR-34a by LncRNAs in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is still reserved to be revealed. In current study, it was hypothesized that a miR-34a interactor, lncRNA CCAT2 may regulate TGF-beta1 pathway in liver fibrotic remodeling. The interaction between CCAT2 and miR-34a-5p was checked by dual luciferase assay. the effects of CCAT2 and miR-34a-5p on cell proliferation and apoptosis were verified by MTT assay, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry assay. Dual luciferase activity showed CCAT2 are targets of miR-34a-5p. Sh-CCAT2 transfection prohibit HSCs proliferation and induce HSCs apoptosis, also inhibited ECM protein synthesis in HSCs. Decreased miR-34a-5p enhanced HSCs proliferation, blocked HSCs apoptosis and promoted ECM protein production. miR-34a-5p inhibitor undo protective regulation of sh-CCAT2 in liver fibrosis. Furthermore, clinical investigation showed that CCAT2 and Smad4 expression level were significantly induced, while miR-34a-5p was significantly decreased in HBV related liver fibrosis serum.

Although varenicline has been found to be the most effective medication for smoking cessation and abstinence when compared to results from placebo medications, nicotine patches and bupropion, caution is needed when starting patients on this medication. With the high prevalence of concurrent mental health and substance use disorders in vulnerably-housed populations in Canada, it becomes increasingly important to advocate for increased guidance and research into treating concurrent disorders. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case, a young female patient provisionally diagnosed with bipolar I disorder was hospitalized for a manic episode in the context of substance use and medication noncompliance. She also endorsed a long history of tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis and ketamine use. Perceptual abnormalities, including auditory hallucinations, were not recorded at admission. In addition to being stabilized for bipolar diagnosis, the patient was started on nicotine replacement therapy on Day 7 of admission followed by initiation of varenicline for smoking cessation on Day 14 of admission. Soon after the varenicline treatment was started, the patient developed auditory hallucinations, paranoia and referential beliefs. However, her insight was intact, and she had minimal thought form disorganization. In this case, these symptoms were thought to be secondary to varenicline after the consideration of potential alternative contributors. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of side effects as a result of varenicline use in patients with diagnosed mental health conditions is rare and underlying psychiatric illness is not labeled as an absolute contraindication in the prescription of varenicline. However, it is important to advocate for increased guidance and research on the treatment of substance use disorders in patients with bipolar I disorder. Patients may also benefit from increased collaboration between psychiatric and addiction services as that may allow for earlier recognition and intervention of symptoms to minimize distress.", "pmid": "36597062"}

Here, we explore whether skeletal muscle density and area are associated with markers of inflammation and immune activation. METHODS: ART-naive people with HIV were randomized to raltegravir or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir or darunavir, each with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine. Abdominal computed tomography scans from baseline and week 96 were reanalyzed for psoas density and area and correlations explored with inflammation [interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein] and immune activation [soluble CD14 (sCD14), soluble CD163 (sCD163), and %CD38+HLADR+ on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells]. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two participants had available inflammation/immune activation markers and paired computed tomography scans. At baseline, lower psoas density (greater fat) correlated with higher IL-6 (r = -0.26, P < 0.001) and sCD163 (r -0.15, P = 0.03) and lower lean psoas area correlated with higher IL-6, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, sCD14, sCD163, and %CD38+HLADR+ on CD4+ T cells (r = -0.30-0.13; all P <= 0.05). From baseline to week 96, greater percent decrease in total psoas density (more fat) correlated with greater increase in IL-6 (r = -0.14; P = 0.04); greater % decrease in lean psoas area correlated greater increases in IL-6, sCD14, sCD163, and %CD38+HLADR+ on CD8+ T cells (r = -0.15 to -0.18; all P < 0.04).

It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner due to mutations in the SLC2A2 gene. SLC2A2 encodes for the glucose transporter GLUT2 and is expressed in tissues that are involved in glucose homeostasis. The molecular mechanisms of dysglycemia in FBS are still not clearly understood. In this study, we report two cases of FBS with classical phenotypes of FBS associated with dysglycemia. Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed by whole-genome and Sanger sequencing, and patient PBMCs were used for molecular analysis. One patient had an exonic SLC2A2 mutation (c.1093C>T in exon 9, R365X), while the other patient had a novel intronic SLC2A2 mutation (c.613-7T>G). Surprisingly, the exonic mutation resulted in the overexpression of dysfunctional GLUT2, resulting in the dysregulated expression of other glucose transporters. The intronic mutation did not affect the coding sequence of GLUT2, its expression, or glucose transport activity. However, it was associated with the expression of miRNAs correlated with type 1 diabetes mellitus, with a particular significant overexpression of hsa-miR-29a-3p implicated in insulin production and secretion. Our findings suggest that SLC2A2 mutations cause dysglycemia in FBS either by a direct effect on GLUT2 expression and/or activity or, indirectly, by the dysregulated expression of miRNAs implicated in glucose homeostasis.", "pmid": "36140215"}

Women with PCOS are prone to develop insulin resistance which has metabolic characteristics similar to type 2 diabetes and leads to disturbance of follicular formation. PCOS is also known to increase the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines, namely TNF-alpha. Moringa oleifera leaves have been shown to have compounds that can reduce insulin levels and glucose levels in diabetes mellitus and should be able to reduce TNF-alpha and follicle count. Purpose: This study aims to prove the effectiveness of Moringa oleifera leaf in reducing insulin, glucose levels, TNF-alpha and follicle count in PCOS. Methods: The three-month-old white rats Wistar (Rattus norvegicus) 150-170 grams were divided into four groups (n = 10), namely normal rats, PCOS model rats, PCOS model rats given metformin, and PCOS rats given 500mg of Moringa oleifera. The method of this study is taking PCOS model rats by injecting the 100mg/kg BW hormone testosterone propionate for 21 days. After 21 days of therapy, we analyzed insulin, glucose levels, TNF-alpha and follicle count. Results: The PCOS control group showed an increase in insulin level, glucose levels, TNF-alpha expression, and a decrease in the follicle count compared to the normal control group. The insulin level, glucose level, TNF-alpha and follicle count in the Moringa oleifera 500 mg/kg BW treatment group were significantly lower than in the PCOS control group.

Traditional antibiotic therapies against this pathogen have been failing, leading to rising concerns over management options for patients. Two new antibiotics, eravacycline and omadacycline, were introduced to the market and have shown promising results in the treatment of Gram-negative infections. Since these drugs are newly available, there is limited in vitro data about their effectiveness against MDR A. baumannii or even susceptible strains. Here, we examined the effectiveness of 22 standard-of-care antibiotics, eravacycline, and omadacycline against susceptible and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii patient isolates from Cooper University Hospital. Furthermore, we examined selected combinations of eravacycline or omadacycline with other antibiotics against an XDR strain. We demonstrated that this collection of strains is largely resistant to monotherapies of carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, folate pathway antagonists, cephalosporins, and most tetracyclines. While clinical breakpoint data are not available for eravacycline or omadacycline, based on minimum inhibitory concentrations, eravacycline was highly effective against these strains. The aminoglycoside amikacin alone and in combination with eravacycline or omadacycline yielded the most promising results.

The Go-Ichi-Ni-San (GINS) complex plays a crucial role in DNA replication and the cell cycle. The GINS complex consists of four subunits encoded by the GINS1, GINS2, GINS3, and GINS4 genes. Recent findings have shown that GINS2 expression is upregulated in many diseases, particularly tumors. For example, increased GINS2 expression has been found in cervical cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, glioma, non-small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic cancer. It correlates with the clinicopathological characteristics of the tumors. In addition, high GINS2 expression plays a pro-carcinogenic role in tumor development by promoting tumor cell proliferation and migration, inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis, and blocking the cell cycle. This review describes the upregulation of GINS2 expression in most human tumors and the pathway of GINS2 in tumor development.

Efforts must therefore continue to be made to obviate this setback OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cardiovascular and respiratory changes during unilateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: With ethical approval, we studied 74 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), physical status class 1 and 2 patients scheduled for elective unilateral lower limb surgery. Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups: lateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia groups. In the lateral position with operative side down, patients recived 10 mg (2mls) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine through a 25-gauge spinal needle. Patients in the unilateral group were maintained in the lateral position for 15 minutes following spinal injection while those in the conventional group were turned supine immediately after injection. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were monitored over 1 hour. RESULTS: Three patients (8.1%) in the unilateral group and 5 (13.5%) in the conventional group developed hypotension, P= 0.71. Four (10.8%) patients in the conventional group and 1 (2.7%) in the unilateral group, P= 0.17 required epinephrine infusion to treat hypotension. Patients in the conventional group had statistically significant greater fall in the systolic blood pressures at 15, 30 and 45 minutes when compared to the baseline (P= 0.003, 0.001 and 0.004).

It was performed the comet assay to evaluate DNA damage. The immunophenotyping of TCD4+ lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood was performed by flow cytometry. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PON1, XRCC1, IL6, IL6R, TNF-alpha, and MIR137 genes were evaluated by real-time PCR. The exposed group was composed mostly by males (69.44%), with direct exposure to pesticides (56%) and with an average age range of 46 +- 13.89 years, being that 58.3% of farmworkers directly exposed to pesticides and reported the full use of personal protective equipment (PPE). DNA damage was greater in the exposed group (p < 0.05), reinforced by the use of PPE to denote a lower degree of DNA damage (p = 0.002). In this context, in the exposed group, we demonstrated that the use of PPE, age, gender and intoxication events were the variables that most contributed to increase DNA damage (p < 0.0001). Besides, the exposed group showed a significant increase in the subpopulations of T lymphocytes CD3+CD4+ (p < 0.05) and CD3+CD4+CD25+ (p < 0.0001) and a significant decrease in CD3+CD4+CD25-FOXP3+ (p < 0.05). SNPs in the TNF-alpha (rs361525) gene presented a difference in the genotype distribution between the groups (p = 0.002). The genotype distribution of TNF-alpha (rs361525) was also positively correlated with the DNA damage of the exposed group (r = 0.19; p = 0.01), demonstrating a higher risk of DNA damage in the farmworkers presenting the A mutated allele. Our findings demonstrate that pesticides can exert various deleterious effects on human health by damaging the DNA as well as by influencing the immune system in the case of both direct or indirect exposure and these issues are associated to age, gender, intoxication and the nonuse of PPE.", "pmid": "32920385"}

We collected the research results and related MeSH terms of denosumab from 2011 to 2021 through the Web of Science and PubMed, respectively. The literature was visualized and analyzed by CiteSpace and bibliometric online analysis platforms. The MeSH terms were biclustered using the Bibliographic Co-Occurrence Analysis System (BICOMB) and graph clustering toolkit (gCLUTO). The results show that the number of denosumab-related annual publications had increased from 51 to 215, with the United States leading and Amgen Inc. being the most influential in the past 10 years. Articles published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research had the highest total citations. Three scholars from Shinshu University in Matsumoto, Yukio Nakamura, Takako Suzuki, and Hiroyuki Kato, joined the field relatively late but produced the most. The clinical comparison and combination of denosumab with other drugs in the treatment of osteoporosis was the most significant focus of research. Drug withdrawal rebound and management strategies have gained more attention and controversy recently. MeSH analysis revealed eight major categories of research hotspots. Among them, exploring the multiple roles of the RANK-RANKL-OPG system in tumor progression, metastasis, and other diseases is the potential direction of future mechanism research. It is a valuable surgical topic to optimize the perioperative drug administration strategy for internal spinal fixation and orthopedic prosthesis implantation.

Inhibition of other proteins in this pathway including PARP, DNA-PK, WEE1, CHK1/2, ATR, or ATM can sensitize cancer cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and such combinations are currently being tested in clinical trials for treatment of many malignancies including breast, ovarian, rectal, and lung cancer. Unrepaired DNA damage induced by DNA damage response inhibitors alone or in combination with radio- or chemotherapy has a direct cytotoxic effect on cancer cells and can also engage anti-cancer innate and adaptive immune responses. DNA damage-induced immune stimulation occurs by a variety of mechanisms including by the cGAS/STING pathway, STAT1 and downstream TRAIL pathway activation, and direct immune cell activation. Whether or not the relative contribution of these mechanisms varies after treatment with different DNA damage response inhibitors or across cancers with different genetic aberrations in DNA damage response enzymes is not well-characterized, limiting the design of optimal combinations with radio- and chemotherapy.

This new DGUOK homozygous mutation (c.444-62C>A) was identified in three patients from two North-African consanguineous families with combined respiratory chain deficiencies and mitochondrial DNA depletion in the liver. Brain MRIs are normal in DGUOK patients in the literature. Interestingly, we found subtentorial abnormal myelination and moderate hyperintensity in the bilateral pallidi in our patients. This new mutation creates a cryptic splice site in intron 3 (in position -62) and is predicted to result in a larger protein with an in-frame insertion of 20 amino acids. In silico analysis of the putative impact of the insertion shows serious clashes in protein conformation: this insertion disrupts the alpha5 helix of the dGK kinase domain, rendering the protein unable to bind purine deoxyribonucleosides. In addition, a common haplotype that segregated with the disease in both families was detected by haplotype reconstruction with 10 markers (microsatellites and SNPs), which span 4.6 Mb of DNA covering the DGUOK locus.

Here, we report analyses of a crystal structure of human LysRS, in which the two enzymatic pockets of the LysRS dimer are in different states. One pocket is vacant of ATP, and the other is in an intermediate state of ATP recognition. Interestingly, only one magnesium ion instead of three is bound in both states.

Serum creatinine (SCr) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications. The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 micromol/L) over baseline. Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25%, a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25%, and the mean peak change in SCr. In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of diabetes mellitus, use of N-acetylcysteine, mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups.

Data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted and the Cochrane Risk of Bias risk assessment tool was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. Revman 5.3 and Stata17 were used to perform the meta-analysis and to detect publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 14 RCTs with 3545 patients were included in this study, including 926 in the pregabalin treatment group, 1256 in the gabapentin treatment group, and 1363 in the placebo control group. Pregabalin was better than gabapentin in alleviating pain and improving the global perception of change in pain and sleep (P < 0.05).

{"abstract_id": "945", "title": "SIRT3 mediates the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on inflammation, autophagy, and oxidative stress in endothelial cells.", "abstract": "Background: Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (i) are a class of lipid-lowering drugs suggested to hold a plethora of beneficial effects independent of their LDL cholesterol-lowering properties. However, the mechanism underlying such observations is debated. Methods: Human aortic endothelial cells (TeloHAEC) were pre-treated with 100 microg/mL of the PCSK9i evolocumab and then exposed to 20 ng/mL of IL-6, a major driver of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), in both naive state and after siRNA-mediated suppression of the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3). Inflammation, autophagy, and oxidative stress were assessed through Western Blots, ELISAs, and/or immunofluorescence coupled by flow cytometry. To explore the human relevance of the findings, we also evaluated the expression of IL-6, SIRT3, IL-1beta, the ratio LC3B II/I, and PCSK9 within the plaques of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (n=277), testing possible correlations between these proteins. Results: PCSK9i improved a range of phenotypes including the activation of inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress, and autophagy. Indeed, treatment with PCSK9i was able to counteract the IL-6 induced increase in inflammasome activation, the accrual of autophagic cells, and mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Of note, silencing of SIRT3 reverted the beneficial effects observed with PCSK9i treatment on all these phenomena. In atheroma specimens, the expression of PCSK9 was inversely related to that of SIRT3 while positively correlating with IL-6, IL-1beta, and the ratio LC3B II/I. Conclusions: Overall, these data suggest that PCSK9i bear intrinsic anti-inflammatory, anti-autophagic, and antioxidant properties in endothelial cells, and that these pleiotropic effects might be mediated, at least in part, by SIRT3. These results provide an additional mechanism supporting the emerging knowledge relative to the benefit of PCSK9i on CVD beyond LDL-lowering and uncover SIRT3 as a putative mediator of such pleiotropy.", "pmid": "36632236"}
{"abstract_id": "946", "title": "Rodent models for nicotine withdrawal.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Animal models are critical to improve our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine dependence in rodents can be established by repeated nicotine injections, chronic nicotine infusion via osmotic minipumps, oral nicotine intake, tobacco smoke exposure, nicotine vapor exposure, and e-cigarette aerosol exposure. The time course of nicotine withdrawal symptoms associated with these methods has not been reviewed in the literature. AIM: The goal of this review is to discuss nicotine withdrawal symptoms associated with the cessation of nicotine, tobacco smoke, nicotine vapor, and e-cigarette aerosol exposure in rats and mice. Furthermore, age and sex differences in nicotine withdrawal symptoms are reviewed. RESULTS: Cessation of nicotine, tobacco smoke, nicotine vapor, and e-cigarette aerosol exposure leads to nicotine withdrawal symptoms such as somatic withdrawal signs, changes in locomotor activity, anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, learning and memory deficits, attention deficits, hyperalgesia, and dysphoria. These withdrawal symptoms are most pronounced within the first week after cessation of nicotine exposure. Anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, and deficits in learning and memory may persist for several months. Adolescent (4-6 weeks old) rats and mice display fewer nicotine withdrawal symptoms than adults (>8 weeks old). In adult rats and mice, females show fewer nicotine withdrawal symptoms than males. The smoking cessation drugs bupropion and varenicline reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms in rodents. CONCLUSION: The nicotine withdrawal symptoms that are observed in rodents are similar to those observed in humans. Tobacco smoke and e-cigarette aerosol contain chemicals and added flavors that enhance the reinforcing properties of nicotine. Therefore, more valid animal models of tobacco and e-cigarette use need to be developed by using tobacco smoke and e-cigarette aerosol exposure methods to induce dependence.", "pmid": "33888006"}

Our laboratory demonstrated that its protection against myocardial dysfunction occurs by the low molecular weight (LMW) isoform of FGF2, while the high molecular weight (HMW) isoforms are associated with a worsening in post-ischemic recovery of cardiac function. LMW FGF2-mediated cardioprotection is facilitated by activation of multiple kinases, including PKCalpha, PKCepsilon, and ERK, and inhibition of p38 and JNK. OBJECTIVE: Yet, the substrates of those kinases associated with LMW FGF2-induced cardioprotection against myocardial dysfunction remain to be elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS: To identify substrates in LMW FGF2 improvement of post-ischemic cardiac function, mouse hearts expressing only LMW FGF2 were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and analyzed by a mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative phosphoproteomic strategy. MS analysis identified 50 phosphorylation sites from 7 sarcoendoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins that were significantly altered in I/R-treated hearts only expressing LMW FGF2 compared to those hearts lacking FGF2. One of those phosphorylated SR proteins identified was phospholamban (PLB), which exhibited rapid, increased phosphorylation at Threonine-17 (Thr17) after I/R in hearts expressing only LMW FGF2; this was further validated using Selected Reaction Monitoring-based MS workflow. To demonstrate a mechanistic role of phospho-Thr17 PLB in LMW FGF2-mediated cardioprotection, hearts only expressing LMW FGF2 and those expressing only LMW FGF2 with a mutant PLB lacking phosphorylatable Thr17 (Thr17Ala PLB) were subjected to I/R. Hearts only expressing LMW FGF2 showed significantly improved recovery of cardiac function following I/R (p < 0.05), and this functional improvement was significantly abrogated in hearts expressing LMW FGF2 and Thr17Ala PLB (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that LMW FGF2 modulates intracellular calcium handling/cycling via regulatory changes in SR proteins essential for recovery from I/R injury, and thereby protects the heart from post-ischemic cardiac dysfunction.", "pmid": "32853649"}

Experimentally, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography technique coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was used to profile the chemical components and the absorbed prototype constituents in rat serum after its oral administration, and 11 out of 108 compounds were identified. Calculatingly, the disease targets of Han-Shi-Yu-Fei symptoms of COVID-19 were constructed through the TCMIP V2.0 database. The subsequent network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis explored the molecular mechanism of the absorbed prototype constituents in the treatment of COVID-19. A total of 42 HSYFD targets oriented by COVID-19 clinical symptom were obtained, with EGFR, TP53, TNF, JAK2, NR3C1, TH, COMT, and DRD2 as the core targets. Enriched pathway analysis yielded multiple COVID-19-related signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and JAK-STAT pathway. Molecular docking showed that the key compounds, such as 6-gingerol, 10-gingerol, and scopoletin, had high binding activity to the core targets like COMT, JAK2, and NR3C1.

However, the expression and roles of Fyn in trophoblasts remain unclear. Here, we aimed to evaluate the participation of Fyn in trophoblast behavior and function, and the related mechanisms were briefly explored. Fyn expression in the HTR-8/SVneo, JEG-3, and JAR cell lines was evaluated by immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Fyn expression in human hydatidiform moles was also determined by immunohistochemistry and western blot. To explore the effects of Fyn, HTR-8/SVneo and JEG-3 cells were transfected with Fyn shRNA or overexpression plasmid or treated with the Fyn activity inhibitor SU6656 or ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. The migration, proliferation, and apoptosis of trophoblast cells were assessed using transwell assays, flow cytometry, and cell counting kit-8 assays, respectively. The production of primary inflammatory cytokines, HLA-G and active matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) 2/9, and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 were evaluated by ELISA, western blot, or gelatin zymography. The results showed that Fyn was expressed by trophoblast cells, mainly in the cytoplasm and membrane. Fyn expression and activity levels both increased in order from HTR-8/SVneo and JAR to JEG-3. The overexpression of Fyn promoted the proliferation and migration of trophoblast cells and inhibited their apoptosis, while the opposite effects were observed for Fyn knockdown and inhibition. Fyn regulated inflammatory cytokine production in trophoblast cells by promoting TGF-beta and IL-4 secretion while inhibiting IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secretion. Moreover, HLA-G expression in JEG-3 was positively regulated by Fyn. Fyn also facilitated the expression of active MMP2/9 and the activation of ERK1/2 and STAT3. Besides, it was confirmed that Fyn regulated trophoblast cell activities through ERK1/2 signal pathway by using U0126. Our study first detected the expression of Fyn in trophoblast cells. Fyn played pivotal roles in trophoblast cell behaviors and function, ERK1/2 was one of its targets, and MMP2/9 and STAT3 may also be involved in the regulatory mechanism.", "pmid": "36330453"}

EGFR-targeted therapies have shown benefits for HPV-negative HNSCC; surprisingly, inhibiting EGFR in HPV-associated HNSCC led to inferior therapeutic outcomes suggesting opposing roles for EGFR in the two HNSCC subtypes. The current study aimed to understand the link between EGFR and HPV-infected HNSCC particularly the regulation of HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7. We demonstrate that EGFR overexpression suppresses cellular proliferation and increases radiosensitivity of HPV-positive HNSCC cell lines. EGFR overexpression inhibited protein expression of BRD4, a known cellular transcriptional regulator of HPV E6/E7 expression and DNA damage repair facilitator. Inhibition of EGFR by cetuximab restored the expression of BRD4 leading to increased HPV E6 and E7 transcription. Concordantly, pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 led to suppression of HPV E6 and E7 transcription, delayed cellular proliferation and sensitised HPV-positive HNSCC cells to ionising radiation. This effect was shown to be mediated through EGFR-induced upregulation of microRNA-9-5p and consequent silencing of its target BRD4 at protein translational level, repressing HPV E6 and E7 transcription and restoring p53 tumour suppressor functions. These results suggest a novel mechanism for EGFR inhibition of HPV E6/E7 oncoprotein expression through an epigenetic pathway, independent of MAPK, but mediated through microRNA-9-5p/BRD4 regulation. Therefore, targeting EGFR may not be the best course of therapy for certain cancer types including HPV-positive HNSCC, while targeting specific signalling pathways such as BRD4 could provide a better and potentially new treatment to improve HNSCC therapeutic outcome.", "pmid": "36333293"}

Some COVID-19 patients develop a severe and critical illness, spurred on by excessive inflammation that can lead to respiratory or multiorgan failure. Numerous studies have established the unique array of cytoprotective properties of the dietary amino acid ergothioneine. Based on studies in a range of in vitro and in vivo models, ergothioneine has exhibited the ability to modulate inflammation, scavenge free radicals, protect against acute respiratory distress syndrome, prevent endothelial dysfunction, protect against ischemia and reperfusion injury, protect against neuronal damage, counteract iron dysregulation, hinder lung and liver fibrosis, and mitigate damage to the lungs, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and testis, amongst many others. When compiled, this evidence suggests that ergothioneine has a potential application in the treatment of the underlying pathology of COVID-19. We propose that ergothioneine could be used as a therapeutic to reduce the severity and mortality of COVID-19, especially in the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.

The present study was performed to investigate the existence of an association between CFI genetic polymorphisms and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome. METHODS: A total of 100 patients diagnosed with VKH syndrome and 300 healthy controls were recruited for the study. Two milliliters of peripheral blood were collected in a sterile anticoagulative tube. CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms were genotyped using Sequenom MassARRAY technology. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using a X(2) test. The analyses were stratified for recurrent status, complicated cataract status, and steroid-sensitive status. RESULTS: No significant association was found between CFI-rs7356506 polymorphisms and VKH syndrome. However, patients with recurrent VKH syndrome had lower frequencies of the G allele and GG homozygosity in CFI-rs7356506 when compared to the controls (p=0.016, odds ratio [OR]=0.429, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.212-0.871; p=0.014, OR=0.364, 95% CI=0.158-0.837, respectively).

In the present study, we show that this molecule also presents in vitro and in vivo specific antileishmanial activity against Leishmania infantum. Results showed an in vitro direct action against L. infantum promastigotes and amastigotes, and low toxicity to mammalian cells.

Limited understanding of the mechanisms in HCC impedes the development of efficacious therapies. Despite Krupple-Like factors (KLFs) were reported to be participated in HCC pathogenesis, the function of KLF14 in HCC remains largely unexplored. METHODS: We generated KLF14 overexpressed and silenced liver cancer cells, and nude mouse xenograft models for the in vitro and in vivo study. Luciferase reporter assay, ChIP-qPCR, Co-IP, immunofluorescence were performed for mechanism research. The expression of KLF14 in HCC samples was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. RESULTS: KLF14 was significantly downregulated in human HCC tissues, which was highly correlated with poor prognosis. Inhibition of KLF14 promoted liver cancer cells proliferation and overexpression of KLF14 suppressed cells growth. KLF14 exerts its anti-tumor function by inhibiting Iron-responsive element-binding protein 2 (IRP2), which then causes transferrin receptor-1(TfR1) downregulation and ferritin upregulation on the basis of IRP-IREs system. This then leading to cellular iron deficiency and HCC cells growth suppression in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, KLF14 suppressed the transcription of IRP2 via recruiting SIRT1 to reduce the histone acetylation of the IRP2 promoter, resulting in iron depletion and cell growth suppression. More important, we found fluphenazine is an activator of KLF14, inhibiting HCC cells growth through inducing iron deficiency. CONCLUSION: KLF14 acts as a tumor suppressor which inhibits the proliferation of HCC cells by modulating cellular iron metabolism via the repression of IRP2.

For instance, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) protects nerve cells from noxious stimuli in vitro and in vivo. Recent reports link PUFA supplementation to improving painful diabetic neuropathy (pDN) symptoms, but cellular mechanisms responsible for this therapeutic effect are not well understood. The objective of this study is to identify distinct cellular pathways elicited by dietary omega-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affected by pDN. METHODS: Forty volunteers diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in the \"En Balance-PLUS\" diabetes education study. The volunteers participated in weekly lifestyle/nutrition education and daily supplementation with 1000 mg DHA and 200 mg eicosapentaenoic acid. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire validated clinical determination of baseline and post-intervention pain complaints. Laboratory and untargeted metabolomics analyses were conducted using blood plasma collected at baseline and after three months of participation in the dietary regimen. The metabolomics data were analyzed using random forest, hierarchical clustering, ingenuity pathway analysis, and metabolic pathway mapping. RESULTS: The data show that metabolites involved in oxidative stress and glutathione production shifted significantly to a more anti-inflammatory state post supplementation. Example of these metabolites include cystathionine (+90%), S-methylmethionine (+9%), glycine cysteine-glutathione disulfide (+157%) cysteinylglycine (+19%), glutamate (-11%), glycine (+11%), and arginine (+13.4%). In addition, the levels of phospholipids associated with improved membrane fluidity such as linoleoyl-docosahexaenoyl-glycerol (18:2/22:6) (+253%) were significantly increased. Ingenuity pathway analysis suggested several key bio functions associated with omega-3 PUFA supplementation such as formation of reactive oxygen species (p = 4.38 x 10-4, z-score = -1.96), peroxidation of lipids (p = 2.24 x 10-5, z-score = -1.944), Ca2+ transport (p = 1.55 x 10-4, z-score = -1.969), excitation of neurons (p = 1.07 x10-4, z-score = -1.091), and concentration of glutathione (p = 3.06 x 10-4, z-score = 1.974).

Results: By Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with ECHDC3high demonstrated inferior overall survival (OS) compared to those with ECHDC3low both in the training (2-year OS, 55.6% vs. 100%, p = 0.011) and validation cohorts (5-year OS, 9.6% vs. 24.3%, p = 0.002). In addition, ECHDC3high predicted inferior OS in the subgroup of patients with ELN 2017 intermediated (int) risk (5-year OS, 9.5% vs. 26.3%, p = 0.039) or FLT3+NPM1- adverse (adv) risk (4-year OS, 6.4% vs. 31.8%, p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, ECHDC3 was an independent risk factor of inferior OS (HR 1.159, 95% CI 1.013-1.326, p = 0.032). In the prediction model combining ECHDC3 and nine selected genes (RPS6KL1, RELL2, FAM64A, SPATS2L, MEIS3P1, CDCP1, CD276, IL1R2, and OLFML2A) by Lasso regression, patients with high risk showed inferior 5-year OS (9.3% vs. 23.5%, p < 0.001). Bioinformatic analysis suggested that ECHDC3 alters the bone marrow microenvironment by inducing NK, resting mast cell, and monocyte differentiation. Knocking down ECHDC3 in AML cells by RNAi promoted the death of leukemia cells with cytarabine and doxorubicin. Conclusion: These bioinformatic analyses and experimental verification indicated that high ECHDC3 expression might be a poor prognostic biomarker for non-APL AML, which might be a potential target for reverting chemoresistance.", "pmid": "36172164"}

GDM women are with inflammatory and metabolisms abnormalities. However, few studies have focused on the association of IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha -857C/T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), inflammatory biomarkers, and metabolic indexes in women with GDM, especially in the Inner Mongolia population. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha -857C/T SNPs, and inflammation and metabolic biomarkers in women with GDM pregnancies. MATERIAL AND METHODS Blood samples and placentas from 140 women with GDM and 140 women with healthy pregnancies were collected. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and MassARRAY-IPLEX were performed to analyze IL-65-72C/G and TNF-alpha -857C/T SNPs. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to analyze inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines. RESULTS Distribution frequency of TNF-alpha -857CT (OR=3.316, 95% CI=1.092-8.304, p=0.025) in women with GDM pregnancies were obviously higher than that in women with healthy pregnancies. Women with GDM were of older maternal age, had higher BMI, were more nulliparous, and had T2DM and GDM history, compared to women with healthy pregnancies (p   <0.05). Inflammatory biomarkers in serum (hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, IL-6/IL-10 ratio) and placental (NF-kappaB, IL-6, IL-8, IL-6/IL-10 ratio, IL-1b, TNF-alpha) were significantly different (p   <0.05) between women with GDM and women with healthy pregnancies.

METHODS: This study included individuals free of stroke at baseline from the UK Biobank. Night-shift work was assessed by the self-reported questions. MTNR1B rs10830963 was directly genotyped (CC, GC, and GG). Incident stroke was ascertained through hospital records and death registries. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to examine the associations of night shift work and MTNR1B rs10830963 with the risk of incident stroke. RESULTS: A total of 242 194 participants were finally included (mean age: 52.95 years; 51.63% women). Over 12-year follow-up, 3287 incident stroke events occurred. Night shift work increased the risk of incident stroke [hazard ratio (HR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.28] after adjusting for socio-demographics, and this association attenuated after additional adjustment for lifestyle factors (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94-1.20). MTNR1B rs10830963 polymorphism modified the association between night shift work and incident stroke (Pfor interaction =0.010). In the Cox models adjusted for socio-demographics and lifestyle factors, among night-shift workers, minor allele G was associated with a reduced risk of incident stroke (GC versus CC, HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.95; GG versus CC, HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40-1.06; P for trend=0.010); while night shift work was associated with a higher stroke risk only among MTNR1B rs10830963 CC carriers (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.05-1.44) but not GC/GG carriers.

As CI is a central player of cellular bioenergetics, a finely tuned dosing of targeting drugs is required to avoid side effects. We compared the specificity and mode of action of CI inhibitors metformin, BAY 87-2243 and EVP 4593 using cancer cell models devoid of CI. Here we show that both BAY 87-2243 and EVP 4593 were selective, while the antiproliferative effects of metformin were considerably independent from CI inhibition. Molecular docking predictions indicated that the high efficiency of BAY 87-2243 and EVP 4593 may derive from the tight network of bonds in the quinone binding pocket, although in different sites. Most of the amino acids involved in such interactions are conserved across species and only rarely found mutated in human. Our data make a case for caution when referring to metformin as a CI-targeting compound, and highlight the need for dosage optimization and careful evaluation of molecular interactions between inhibitors and the holoenzyme.", "pmid": "36349549"}

In addition, the treatment regimens for many sarcomas, including Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma, are relatively unchanged over the past two decades, indicating a critical lack of progress. Although differentiation-based therapies are used for the treatment of some cancers, the application of this approach to sarcomas has proven challenging. Here, using a CRISPR-mediated gene knockout approach, we show that Inhibitor of DNA Binding 2 (ID2) is a critical regulator of developmental-related genes and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in Ewing sarcoma tumors. We also identified that homoharringtonine, which is an inhibitor of protein translation and FDA-approved for the treatment of leukemia, decreases the level of the ID2 protein and significantly reduces tumor growth and prolongs mouse survival in an Ewing sarcoma xenograft model. Furthermore, in addition to targeting ID2, homoharringtonine also reduces the protein levels of ID1 and ID3, which are additional members of the ID family of proteins with well-described roles in tumorigenesis, in multiple types of cancer. Overall, these results provide insight into developmental regulation in Ewing sarcoma tumors and identify a novel, therapeutic approach to target the ID family of proteins using an FDA-approved drug.", "pmid": "35422476"}

However, the relevance of this gene to T2D development is not consistent among diverse populations. In the current study, we aim to capture the possible association of common KCNJ11 variants across Iranian adults, followed by a meta-analysis. We found that the tested variants of KCNJ11 have not contributed to T2D incidence in Iranian adults, consistent with similar insulin secretion levels among individuals with different genotypes. The integration of our results with 72 eligible published case-control studies (41,372 cases and 47,570 controls) as a meta-analysis demonstrated rs5219 and rs5215 are significantly associated with the increased T2D susceptibility under different genetic models. Nevertheless, the stratified analysis according to ethnicity showed rs5219 is involved in the T2D risk among disparate populations, including American, East Asian, European, and Greater Middle Eastern, but not South Asian. Additionally, the meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the sample size of both case and control groups was significantly associated with the magnitude of pooled genetic effect size. The present study can expand our knowledge about the KCNJ11 common variant's contributions to T2D incidence, which is valuable for designing SNP-based panels for potential clinical applications in precision medicine. It also highlights the importance of similar sample sizes for avoiding high heterogeneity and conducting a more precise meta-analysis.", "pmid": "36456687"}

METHODS: Consecutive patients with untreated, metastatic nonsquamous PD-L1-positive NSCLC who initially received the atezolizumab plus carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel (ACN) regimen or carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel (CN) regimen were retrospectively identified in two medical institutions from 2017 to 2020. The co-primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end point was the rate of key adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: In sum, 171 patients were retrospectively analysed, 47 of whom were excluded according to the criteria used in this study, leaving 124 patients (ACN: n = 60, median age 64 years [range 46-75]; CN: n = 64, 63 years [47-72]). The median duration of follow-up was 27 months [range 1-37]. At the final follow-up, the median OS was 19.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.3-22.5) in the ACN group vs. 14.8 months (95% CI 12.5-17.2) in the CN group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.77; p = 0.001). A marked distinction in the median PFS was seen (8.5 months [95% CI 6.7-9.4] in the ACN group vs. in the CN group [5.1 months [95% CI 3.6-6.8; HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.38-0.95; p = 0.005]). The rates of the key AEs (neutropenia and anaemia) were greater in the ACN group than in the CN group (all p < 0.05), but these AEs were manageable.

CD8 T cells are also implicated in MS but their function is not well understood. MS lesions are heterogeneous and may reflect variation in the contribution of different types of lymphocytes. Understanding how lymphocytes with different effector functions contribute to MS is essential to develop effective therapies. We investigated how T cells expressing an MHC class I-restricted transgenic TCR specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) contribute to CNS autoimmunity using the mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Virus infection triggered cytotoxic TCR-transgenic CD8 T cells to initiate acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in an IFN-gamma- and perforin-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, spontaneous CNS autoimmunity developed in the TCR-transgenic mice that was accelerated by IFN-gamma-deficiency. Spontaneous disease was associated with CD4 T cells that develop via endogenous TCR rearrangements but retain specificity for the MHC class I-restricted MBP epitope. The CD4 T cells produced TNF-alpha without other inflammatory cytokines and caused lesions with striking similarity to active MS lesions. Surprisingly, B cells were the predominant cell type that cross-presented MBP, and their depletion halted disease progression. This work provides a new model of spontaneous CNS autoimmunity with unique similarities to MS that is mediated by T cells with a distinct effector phenotype.", "pmid": "36426938"}

Curcumin and its analogues were found to have promising anticancer activity. Inspired by curcumin's promising anticancer activity, we prepared three semi-synthetic analogues by chemically modifying the diketone function of curcumin to its pyrazole counterpart. The curcumin analogues (3a-c) were synthesized by two different methods, followed by their DFT analyses to study the HOMO/LUMO configuration to access the stability of compounds ( E = 3.55 to 3.35 eV). The curcumin analogues (3a-c) were tested for antiproliferative activity against a total of five dozen cancer cell lines in a single (10 microM) and five dose (0.001 to 100 microM) assays. 3,5-Bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyryl)-1H-pyrazole-1-yl-(phenoxy)ethanone (3b) and 3,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyryl)-1H-pyrazole-1-yl-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)ethanone (3c) demonstrated the most promising antiproliferative activity against the cancer cell lines with growth inhibitions of 92.41% and 87.28%, respectively, in a high single dose of 10 microM and exhibited good antiproliferative activity (%GIs > 68%) against 54 out of 56 cancer cell lines and 54 out of 60 cell lines, respectively. The compound 3b and 3c demonstrated the most potent antiproliferative activity in a 5-dose assay with GI50 values ranging between 0.281 and 5.59 microM and 0.39 and 0.196 and 3.07 microM, respectively. The compound 3b demonstrated moderate selectivity against a leukemia panel with a selectivity ratio of 4.59. The HOMO-LUMO energy-gap ( E) of the compounds in the order of 3a > 3b > 3c, was found to be in harmony with the anticancer activity in the order of 3c >= 3b > 3a. Following that, all of the curcumin analogues were molecular docked against EGFR, one of the most appealing targets for antiproliferative activity. In a molecular docking simulation, the ligand 3b exhibited three different types of interactions: H-bond, pi-pi-stacking and pi-cationic. The ligand 3b displayed three H-bonds with the residues Met793 (with methoxy group), Lys875 (with phenolic group) and Asp855 (with methoxy group). The pi-pi-stacking interaction was observed between the phenyl (of phenoxy) and the residue Phe997, while pi-cationic interaction was displayed between the phenyl (of curcumin) and the residue Arg841. Similarly, the ligand 3c displayed five H-bonds with the residue Met793 (with methoxy and phenolic groups), Lys845 (methoxy group), Cys797 (phenoxy oxygen), and Asp855 (phenolic group), as well as a halogen bond with residue Cys797 (chloro group). Furthermore, all the compound 3a-c demonstrated significant binding affinity (-6.003 to -7.957 kcal/mol) against the active site of EGFR. The curcumin analogues described in the current work might offer beneficial therapeutic intervention for the treatment and prevention of cancer.

This study analyzed the operative experience of Phase 1 trainees (CT1/ST1 vs. CT2/ST2) against the Annual Review of Competence Progression (ARCP) criterion of 120 procedures yearly. Methods: National survey research in October 2021. Study end-point was the completion of >4 weekly procedures, equivalent to 120 cases per year. Chi-square test and multivariate regression analysis were performed. Results: 205 participants from 5 Deaneries were included, 48.3% were CT1/ST1 and 51.7% were CT2/ST2. About 54.5% of year-1 and 50% of year-2 trainees were 28 30 years old, 55.6% and 50.9% were male, and 39.4% and 38.7% were White British. About 39.4% of CT1/ST1 and 22.6% of CT2/ST2 performed <4 weekly procedures (P = 0.01), with no difference in the \"Observed\" (P = 0.6) or \"Assisted\" (P = 0.3) number of cases. CT2/ST2 recorded more \"ST-S\" (p 0.04), \"S-TU\" (P = 0.03), and \"Performed\" (P = 0.02) operations.

The interaction of RCC carbonyl groups with amino groups of molecules is called the Maillard reaction. One of the most active RCCs is alpha-dicarbonyl methylglyoxal (MG) that modifies biomolecules forming non-enzymatic glycation products. Organic free radicals are formed in the reaction between MG and lysine or Nalpha-acetyllysine. S-nitrosothiols and nitric oxide ( NO) donor PAPA NONOate increased the yield of organic free radical intermediates, while other  NO-derived metabolites, namely, nitroxyl anion and dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) decreased it. At the late stages of the Maillard reaction, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) also inhibited the formation of glycation end products (AGEs). The formation of a new type of DNICs, bound with Maillard reaction products, was found. The results obtained were used to explain the glycation features of legume hemoglobin-leghemoglobin (Lb), which is a lysine-rich protein. In Lb, lysine residues can form fluorescent cross-linked AGEs, and  NO-derived metabolites slow down their formation. The knowledge of these processes can be used to increase the stability of Lb.

METHODS: In the population based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 1969-95, was identified. Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified. Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios (ORs) as relative risk. In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener's granulomatosis, and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, were also estimated. RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively. The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9). Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 69).

Metachronous metastases remain to be an unpredictable, unpreventable, and fatal complication, and tracing the molecular chain of events that lead to metastasis would provide mechanistically linked biomarkers for the maintenance of remission in CRC patients after curative treatment. We hypothesized, that Metastasis-associated in colorectal cancer-1 (MACC1) induces a secretory phenotype to enforce metastasis in a paracrine manner, and found, that the cell-free culture medium of MACC1-expressing CRC cells induces migration. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture mass spectrometry (SILAC-MS) of the medium revealed, that S100A4 is significantly enriched in the MACC1-specific secretome. Remarkably, both biomarkers correlate in expression data of independent cohorts as well as within CRC tumor sections. Furthermore, combined elevated transcript levels of the metastasis genes MACC1 and S100A4 in primary tumors and in blood plasma robustly identifies CRC patients at high risk for poor metastasis-free (MFS) and overall survival (OS). Mechanistically, MACC1 strengthens the interaction of beta-catenin with TCF4, thus inducing S100A4 synthesis transcriptionally, resulting in elevated secretion to enforce cell motility and metastasis. In cell motility assays, S100A4 was indispensable for MACC1-induced migration, as shown via knock-out and pharmacological inhibition of S100A4. The direct transcriptional and functional relationship of MACC1 and S100A4 was probed by combined targeting with repositioned drugs. In fact, the MACC1-beta-catenin-S100A4 axis by statins (MACC1) and niclosamide (S100A4) synergized in inhibiting cancer cell motility in vitro and metastasis in vivo.

Here, we discover that the activity of dynamin-2 (Dyn2) in catalyzing GLUT4 endocytosis is negatively regulated by insulin signaling in muscle cells. Mechanistically, the fission activity of Dyn2 is inhibited by binding with the SH3 domain of Bin1. In the absence of insulin, GSK3alpha phosphorylates Dyn2 to relieve the inhibition of Bin1 and promotes endocytosis. Conversely, insulin signaling inactivates GSK3alpha and leads to attenuated GLUT4 internalization. Furthermore, the isoform-specific pharmacological inhibition of GSK3alpha significantly improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in diet-induced insulin-resistant mice.

METHODS: Transcriptome analysis of LX-2 cells was that expression patterns of genes changed by auranofin, and their related pathways were estimated. We used the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) program to determine the pathway involved in overall genetic change. In vitro, LX-2 and HepG2 cells were treated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and palmitic acid (PA), respectively, and the antifibrotic and antiadipogenic effect function of auranofin was evaluated. RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis revealed that auranofin decreased the expression of 15 genes, including thrombospondin 1, endothelin 1 (ET-1), fibronectin 1, and LOX. The molecular functions of these genes are involved in collagen binding. GSEA of the overall gene expression pattern revealed that many genes increased in the reactive oxygen species pathway and decreased in the inflammatory response. Auranofin decreased nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and IkappaBalpha in TGF-beta1-induced LX-2 cells, thereby reducing ET-1 and fibrosis. Furthermore, increased pNRF2 in PA-induced HepG2 cells led to increased antioxidant marker expression and decreased lipid accumulation.

We recently demonstrated that the expression of secreted leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein-1 (LRG1) is associated with worsened kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and that LRG1 enhances endothelial transforming growth factor-beta signaling to promote diabetic kidney disease progression. While the increased expression of LRG1 was most prominent in the glomerular endothelial cells in diabetic kidneys, its increase was also observed in the tubulointerstitial compartment. Here, we explored the potential role of LRG1 in kidney epithelial cells and TGF-beta-mediated tubulointerstitial fibrosis independent of diabetes. LRG1 expression was induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in cultured kidney epithelial cells and potentiated TGF-beta/Smad3 signal transduction. Global Lrg1 loss in mice led to marked attenuation of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in models of unilateral ureteral obstruction and aristolochic acid fibrosis associated with concomitant decreases in Smad3 phosphorylation in tubule epithelial cells. In mice with kidney epithelial cell-specific LRG1 overexpression, while no significant phenotypes were observed at baseline, marked exacerbation of tubulointerstitial fibrosis was observed in the obstructed kidneys. This was associated with enhanced Smad3 phosphorylation in both kidney epithelial cells and alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive interstitial cells. Co-culture of kidney epithelial cells with primary kidney fibroblasts confirmed the potentiation of TGF-beta-mediated Smad3 activation in kidney fibroblasts through epithelial-derived LRG1. Thus, our results indicate that enhanced LRG1 expression-induced epithelial injury is an amplifier of TGF-beta signaling in autocrine and paracrine manners promoting tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Hence, therapeutic targeting of LRG1 may be an effective means to curtail kidney fibrosis progression in chronic kidney disease.", "pmid": "34774561"}

CALGB 9781 trial established cisplatin and 5-flourouracil (5-Fu) with radiotherapy as superior to surgery alone while the CROSS trial established paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiotherapy as superior to surgery alone. Previous data has been unclear as to which regimen provides a superior pathologic response. This study aims to look at this. This study aims to look at this. Methods: A retrospective chart review at a single institution of patients who underwent esophagectomies after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with either cisplatin and 5-Fu or carboplatin and paclitaxel between 2012-2020 was performed. Demographics as well as staging, response rates, and modified Ryan scores were collected. Univariate analysis between the two groups was performed. Results: A total of 82 patients were identified between 2012-2020 who underwent esophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. In total, 74 (90.2%) received carboplatin and paclitaxel while 8 (9.8%) received 5-Fu and carboplatin. Both groups included patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma. No significant factors were found in terms of patient comorbidities or pathologic staging. There was no significant difference in modified Ryan score between the two groups (P=0.745). Conclusions: This study evaluates the degree and presence of pathologic response between the two neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy modalities used for esophageal cancer. Our results, in contrast to other studies, suggest no significant difference with regards to pathologic response rate.

However, a subset of PTCs shows an unusually aggressive phenotype with extensive lymph node metastasis and higher incidence of locoregional recurrence. In this study, we investigated a large cohort of PTC cases with an unusual aggressive phenotype using a high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify differentially regulated genes associated with metastatic PTC. All metastatic PTC with mutated BRAF (V600E) but not BRAF wild-type expressed an up-regulation of R-Spondin Protein 4 (RSPO4) concomitant with an upregulation of genes involved in focal adhesion and cell-extracellular matrix signaling. Further immunohistochemistry validation confirmed the upregulation of these target genes in metastatic PTC cases. Preclinical studies using established PTC cell lines support that RSPO4 overexpression is associated with BRAF V600E mutation and is a critical upstream event that promote activation of kinases of focal adhesion signaling known to drive cancer cell locomotion and invasion. This finding opens up the potential of co-targeting B-Raf, RSPO and focal adhesion proteins as a pharmacological approach for aggressive BRAF V600E PTC.", "pmid": "36611933"}

Compelling evidence suggests that dysregulation of dopamine (DA) induces neuronal stress and damage responses that are operative processes in striatal degeneration preceding PD-like symptoms. Improper DA sequestration to vesicles raises cytosolic DA levels, which is rapidly converted into electrophilic dopaquinone species (DQs) that react readily with protein nucleophiles forming covalent modifications that alter the native structure and function of proteins. These so-called DA-protein adducts (DPAs) have been reported to play a role in neurotoxicity, and their abundance with respect to neurodegeneration has been linked to clinical and pathological features of PD that suggest that they play a causal role in PD pathogenesis. Therefore, characterizing DPAs is a critical first step in understanding the susceptibility of midbrain dopaminergic neurons during PD. To help achieve this goal, we report here a novel DA-mimetic (DAyne) containing a biorthogonal alkyne handle that exhibits a reactivity profile similar to DA in aqueous buffers. By linking DPAs formed with DAyne to a fluorescent reporter molecule, DPAs were visualized in fixed cells and within lysates. DAyne enabled global mapping of cellular proteins affected by DQ modification and their bioactive pathways through enrichment. Our proteomic profiling of DPAs in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells indicates that proteins susceptible to DPA formation are extant throughout the proteome, potentially influencing several diverse biological pathways involved in PD such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, cytoskeletal instability, proteotoxicity, and clathrin function. We validated that a protein involved in the ER stress pathway, protein disulfide isomerase 3 (PDIA3), which was enriched in our chemoproteomic analysis, is functionally inhibited by DA, providing evidence that dysregulated cellular DA may induce or exacerbate ER stress. Thus, DAyne provided new mechanistic insights into DA toxicity that may be observed during PD by enabling characterization of DPAs generated reproducibly at physiologically relevant quinone exposures. We anticipate our design and application of this reactivity-based probe will be generally applicable for clarifying mechanisms of metabolic quinone toxicity.", "pmid": "34726906"}

Individuals with colorectal cancer harbor a subpopulation of RORgammat+ Treg cells with elevated expression of beta-catenin and pro-inflammatory properties. Here we show progressive expansion of RORgammat+ Treg cells in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease during inflammation and early dysplasia. Activating Wnt-beta-catenin signaling in human and murine Treg cells was sufficient to recapitulate the disease-associated increase in the frequency of RORgammat+ Treg cells coexpressing multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. Binding of the beta-catenin interacting partner, TCF-1, to DNA overlapped with Foxp3 binding at enhancer sites of pro-inflammatory pathway genes. Sustained Wnt-beta-catenin activation induced newly accessible chromatin sites in these genes and upregulated their expression. These findings indicate that TCF-1 and Foxp3 together limit the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Treg cells.

The matrix lipids, especially the ceramide-generated sphingosine 1-phosphate, are the messengers that the skin barrier uses to communicate with the basal layer of the epidermis where replicating keratinocytes are located. Sphingosine 1-phosphate is a bioactive sphingolipid mediator involved in various cellular functions through S1PR1-5, expressed by keratinocytes. We discovered that the S1pr2 absence is linked to an impairment in the skin barrier function. Although S1pr2-/- mouse skin has no difference in its phenotype and barrier function compared with that of wild-type mouse, after tape stripping, S1pr2-/- mouse showed significantly higher transepidermal water loss and required another 24 hours to normalize their transepidermal water loss levels. Moreover, after epicutaneous Staphylococcus aureus application, impaired S1pr2-/- mouse epidermal barrier function allowed deeper bacterial penetration and denser neutrophil infiltration in the dermis. Microarray and RNA sequence of S1pr2-/- mouse epidermis linked the barrier dysfunction with a decrease in FLG2 and tight junction components. In conclusion, S1pr2-/- mice have compromised skin barrier function and increased bacteria permeability, making them a suitable model for diseases that present similar characteristics, such as atopic dermatitis.", "pmid": "33197483"}

Of particular interest are genes involved in cell cycle pathways, which regulate cell division. METHODS: We examined associations between common germline genetic variation in 13 genes involved in cell cycle control (CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CCNE1, CDK2 [p33], CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A [p21, Cip1], CDKN1B [p27, Kip1], CDKN2A [p16], CDKN2B [p15], CDKN2C [p18], and CDKN2D [p19]) and survival among women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer participating in the SEARCH (Studies of Epidemiology and Risk factors in Cancer Heredity) breast cancer study. DNA from up to 4,470 women was genotyped for 85 polymorphisms that tag the known common polymorphisms (minor allele frequency    > 0.05) in the genes. The genotypes of each polymorphism were tested for association with survival using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The rare allele of the tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2479717 is associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio = 1.26 per rare allele carried, 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.42; P = 0.0001), which was not attenuated after adjusting for tumour stage, grade, and treatment. This SNP is part of a large linkage disequilibrium block, which contains CCND3, BYSL, TRFP, USP49, C6ofr49, FRS3, and PGC. We evaluated the association of survival and somatic expression of these genes in breast tumours using expression microarray data from seven published datasets. Elevated expression of the C6orf49 transcript was associated with breast cancer survival, adding biological interest to the finding. CONCLUSION: It is possible that CCND3 rs2479717, or another variant it tags, is associated with prognosis after a diagnosis of breast cancer.

Variants associated with type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose levels reside in introns of ADCY5, a gene that encodes adenylate cyclase 5. Adenylate cyclase 5 catalyzes the production of cyclic AMP, which is a second messenger molecule involved in cell signaling and pancreatic b-cell insulin secretion. We demonstrated that type 2 diabetes risk alleles are associated with decreased ADCY5 expression in human islets and examined candidate variants for regulatory function. rs11708067 overlaps a predicted enhancer region in pancreatic islets. The type 2 diabetes risk rs11708067-A allele showed fewer H3K27ac ChIP-seq reads in human islets, lower transcriptional activity in reporter assays in rodent b-cells (rat 832/13 and mouse MIN6), and increased nuclear protein binding compared with the rs11708067-G allele. Homozygous deletion of the orthologous enhancer region in 832/13 cells resulted in a 64% reduction in expression level of Adcy5, but not adjacent gene Sec22a, and a 39% reduction in insulin secretion.

VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine-induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg/kg. In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA. Pretreatment with either VPU (50 and 100 mg/kg) or VPA (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate. In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level. Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine-induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate. Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizure in experimental animals.

Then, the anticancer mechanism of the synthesized NPs was investigated using the cellular and molecular tests including MTT assay, Flow cytometry, Caspase-3 activity assay, Hoechst staining and Real Time PCR. The FT-IR and XRD assays confirmed the identity of the synthesized Bi2O3/Gln-TSC NPs. The size range of the synthesized spherical particles was 10-60 nm and the zeta potential was - 23.8 mV.

To understand why these deficiencies exist, we set out to fully elucidate the adhesion mechanisms used by ST and LT-HSCs to migrate to the bone marrow(BM). Specifically focusing on murine ST-HSCs (Flk2-CD34+) and LT-HSCs (Flk2-CD34-), we observed a distinctive expression pattern of BM homing effectors necessary for the first step, namely sialyl Lewis-X (sLex) (ligand for E-selectin), and the second step, namely CXCR4 chemokine receptor (receptor for SDF-1). sLex expression was higher on Flk2-CD34+ ST-HSCs (>60%) compared with Flk2-CD34- LT-HSCs (<10%), which correlated to binding to E-selectin. Higher concentrations of CXCR4 were observed on Flk2-CD34+ ST-HSCs compared with Flk2-CD34- LT-HSCs. Interestingly, the expression of CD26, a peptidase known to deactivate chemokines (ie, SDF-1), was higher on Flk2-CD34- LT-HSCs. Given that both E-selectin-binding and CXCR4-mediated migration are compromised in Flk2-CD34- LT-HSCs, we aimed to enhance their ability to migrate using recombinant human fucosyltransferase 6 (rhFTVI) and the CD26 inhibitor, Dip A (diprotin A). To this end, we observed that although LT-HSCs expressed low concentrations of sLex, they were able to engraft when transplanted into recipient mice. Moreover, although both CD26 inhibition and fucosylation enhanced migration of both HSC populations in vitro, only pretreatment of LT-HSCs with Dip A enhanced engraftment in vivo after transplantation into recipient mice. Remarkably, fucosylation of Flk2-CD34+ ST-HSCs consistently led to their ability to transplant secondary recipients. These data suggest that using fucosylation and Dip A to overcome the molecular disparity in adhesion mechanisms among ST-HSCs and LT-HSCs differentially influences their abilities to migrate and engraft in vivo and promotes the ability of ST-HSCs to engraft secondary recipient mice, the gold standard for testing functionality of LT-HSCs.", "pmid": "35764498"}

Numerous differentially expressed proteins related to the production of NADH, reduced cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2), NADPH and reactive oxygen species (ROS), iron-sulfur cluster binding, and iron ion homeostasis were found to be upregulated by CFDC. Furthermore, parallel reaction monitoring analysis validated these results. Meanwhile, we confirmed that the levels of NADH, ROS, H2O2, and iron ions were induced by CFDC, and the sensitivity of Escherichia coli to CFDC was inhibited by the antioxidant vitamin C, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and deferoxamine. Moreover, deferoxamine also suppressed the H2O2 stress induced by CFDC. In addition, knockout of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase genes (nuoA, nuoC, nuoE, nuoF, nuoG, nuoJ, nuoL, nuoM) in the respiratory chain attenuated the sensitivity of E. coli to CFDC far beyond the effects of cefepime and ceftazidime; in particular, the E. coli BW25113 DeltanuoJ strain produced 60-fold increases in MIC to CFDC compared to that of the wild-type E. coli BW25113 strain.

Here, we report the first antibiotic persistence mechanism in Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is induced by oxidative stress conditions and allows the pneumococcus to survive in the presence of fluoroquinolones. We demonstrated that fluoroquinolone persistence is prompted by both the impact of growth arrest and the oxidative stress response induced by H2O2 in bacterial cells. This process protected pneumococci against the deleterious effects of high ROS levels induced by fluoroquinolones. Importantly, S. pneumoniae develops persistence during infection, and is dependent on the oxidative stress status of the host cells, indicating that its transient intracellular life contributes to this mechanism. Furthermore, our findings suggest persistence may influence the outcome of antibiotic therapy and be part of a multistep mechanism in the evolution of fluoroquinolone resistance. IMPORTANCE In S. pneumoniae, different mechanisms that counteract antibiotic effects have been described, such as vancomycin tolerance, heteroresistance to penicillin and fluoroquinolone resistance, which critically affect the therapeutic efficacy. Antibiotic persistence is a type of antibiotic tolerance that allows a bacterial subpopulation to survive lethal antimicrobial concentrations. In this work, we used a host-cell infection model to reveal fluoroquinolone persistence in S. pneumoniae. This mechanism is induced by oxidative stress that the pneumococcus must overcome to survive in host cells. Many fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, have a broad spectrum of activity against bacterial pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia, and they are used to treat pneumococcal diseases. However, the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains complicates antibiotic treatment of invasive infections. Consequently, antibiotic persistence in S. pneumoniae is clinically relevant due to prolonged exposure to fluoroquinolones likely favors the acquisition of mutations that generate antibiotic resistance in persisters. In addition, this work contributes to the knowledge of antibiotic persistence mechanisms in bacteria.", "pmid": "36445159"}

HLA-B*27 heavy chain (B*27-HC) has an innate characteristic to slowly fold, resulting in the accumulation of the misfolded B*27-HC and the formation of homo-oligomeric B*27-HC molecules. The homo-oligomeric B*27-HC can act as a ligand of KIR3DL2. Interaction of the homo-oligomeric B*27-HC molecules with KIR3DL2 will trigger the survival and activation of KIR3DL2-positive NK cells. However, the effects of homo-oligomeric B*27-HC molecules associated with KIR3DL2 on the cytotoxic activity of NK cells and their cytokine expressions remain unknown. Materials and Methods: HLA-B*-2704-HC was overexpressed in the HMy2.C1R (C1R) cell line. Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR were used to analyze the protein expression and cytokine expression, respectively, when C1R-B*-2704 cells that overexpress B*2704-HC were co-cultured with NK-92MI cells. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cytotoxicity mediated by NK-92MI cells. Results: Our results revealed that NK-92MI cells up-regulated the expression of perforin and enhanced the cytotoxic activity via augmentation of PI3K/AKT signaling after co-culturing with C1R-B*2704 cells. Suppression of the dimerized B*27-HC formation or treatment with an inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, or with an anti-B*27-HC monoclonal antibody can reduce the perforin expression of NK-92MI after co-culturing with C1R-B*-2704.

However, HIF-independent hypoxia response pathways exist that act in parallel with HIF to mediate the physiological hypoxia response. Here, we describe a hypoxia response pathway controlled by Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49, an orthologue of mammalian peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). We show that nhr-49 is required for animal survival in hypoxia and is synthetic lethal with hif-1 in this context, demonstrating that these factors act in parallel. RNA-seq analysis shows that in hypoxia nhr-49 regulates a set of genes that are hif-1-independent, including autophagy genes that promote hypoxia survival. We further show that nuclear hormone receptor nhr-67 is a negative regulator and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase hpk-1 is a positive regulator of the NHR-49 pathway. Together, our experiments define a new, essential hypoxia response pathway that acts in parallel with the well-known HIF-mediated hypoxia response.", "pmid": "35285794"}

Moreover, in some patients ASCT is contraindicated, with limited treatment options. We report the case series of two patients with lymphoid BC CML in whom ASCT was not approachable. The first patient developed BC two months after diagnosis in association with dic(7;9)(p11.2;p11.2) and T315I mutation. Blast crisis with central nervous system leukemic involvement and K611N mutation of the SETD2 gene developed abruptly in the second patient five years after ceasing treatment with nilotinib in major molecular response (MMR) at the patient's request. Both underwent one course of chemotherapy in combination with rituximab and imatinib, followed by dasatinib and interferon alpha (INFalpha) treatment in the first and dasatinib alone in the second case. Deep molecular response (DMR; MR 4.0) was achieved within a short time in both cases. It is probable that DMR was caused by a specific immune response to CML cells, described in both agents. The challenging medical condition that prompted these case series, and the subsequent results, suggest a re-visit to the use of a combination of well-known drugs as an area for further investigation.", "pmid": "36768374"}

However, the multiple reaction parameters affecting the production of AGEs and NAs during sausage processing remain unclear. This experiment evaluated the effects of processing parameters, food additives and fat ratios on the formation of AGEs and NAs in sausages. The results showed a 2-3-fold increase in Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and Nepsilon-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL) when the sausage processing temperature was increased from 90  C to 130  C, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDEA) increased from 3.68 ng/g to 6.41 ng/g. The addition of salt inhibited the formation of AGEs and NAs, and the inhibitory ability of 2 g/100 g of salt was 63.6% for CML and 36.5% for N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). The addition of 10 mg/kg nitrite to sausages reduced CML formation by 43.9%, however, nitrite had a significant contribution to the formation of NAs. The addition of fat only slightly contributed to the production of CML. In addition, the relationship between alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and the formation of AGEs was investigated by measuring the changes in alpha-dicarbonyl compounds in sausages.

Previous data have demonstrated that recruitment to various membranes of the endolysosomal system results in LRRK2 activation. However, the mechanism(s) underlying LRRK2 activation at endolysosomal membranes and the cellular consequences of these events are still poorly understood. Here, we directed LRRK2 to lysosomes and early endosomes, triggering both LRRK2 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the direct LRRK2 substrates Rab10 and Rab12. However, when directed to the lysosomal membrane, pRab10 was restricted to perinuclear lysosomes, whereas pRab12 was visualized on both peripheral and perinuclear LRRK2+ lysosomes, suggesting that lysosomal positioning provides additional regulation of LRRK2-dependent Rab phosphorylation. Anterograde transport of lysosomes to the cell periphery by increasing the expression of ARL8B and SKIP or by knockdown of JIP4 blocked the recruitment and phosphorylation of Rab10 by LRRK2. The absence of pRab10 from the lysosomal membrane prevented the formation of a lysosomal tubulation and sorting process we previously named LYTL. Conversely, overexpression of RILP resulted in lysosomal clustering within the perinuclear area and increased LRRK2-dependent Rab10 recruitment and phosphorylation. The regulation of Rab10 phosphorylation in the perinuclear area depends on counteracting phosphatases, as the knockdown of phosphatase PPM1H significantly increased pRab10 signal and lysosomal tubulation in the perinuclear region. Our findings suggest that LRRK2 can be activated at multiple cellular membranes, including lysosomes, and that lysosomal positioning further provides the regulation of some Rab substrates likely via differential phosphatase activity or effector protein presence in nearby cellular compartments.", "pmid": "36256825"}

We demonstrated for the first time that CTSL was mostly released by exosomes derived from alpha-Syn-activated microglia, resulting in neuronal damage and death. The elevation of CTSL activity was blocked by GW4869, suggesting a critical role for exosomes in mediating CTSL release. Furthermore, the P2X7R/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway was identified as the underlying molecular mechanism since specific antagonists of this signalling pathway, P2X7R knockdown and exosome release inhibitors significantly reduced the injury to cultured mouse cortical neurons. Our study suggests that increased extracellular release of CTSL from alpha-Syn-activated microglia through exosomes amplifies and aggravates of the neurotoxic effect of microglia, implying that CTSL may be involved in a fresh mechanism of PD pathogenesis, and serve as a potential biomarker and a target for PD drug development.", "pmid": "36202834"}
{"abstract_id": "1001", "title": "Multifaceted Defects in Monocytes in Different Phases of Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection: Lack of Restoration after Antiviral Therapy.", "abstract": "Monocytes play an important role in the control of microbial infection, but monocyte biology during chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (CHI) remains inadequately studied. We investigated the frequency, phenotype, and functions of monocyte subsets in different phases of CHI, namely, immune tolerance (IT), hepatitis B early antigen (HBeAg)-positive/HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (EP-/EN-CHB, respectively), and inactive carrier (IC), identified factors responsible for their functional alterations, and determined the impact of antiviral therapy on these cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that HLA-DR+ CD14++ CD16- classical monocytes were significantly reduced while HLA-DR+ CD14++ CD16+ intermediate and HLA-DR+ CD14+ CD16++ nonclassical monocytes were expanded in IT and EP-/EN-CHB compared with those in IC and healthy controls (HC). In comparison to IC/HC, monocytes in IT and CHB exhibited diminished expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2)/TLR-4/TLR-9 and cytokines interleukin-12 (IL-12)/tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)/IL-6 but produced higher levels of IL-10/transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Further, monocytes in CHB/IT showed impaired phagocytosis and oxidative response relative to those in IC/HC. In vitro assays indicated that high titers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) present in IT/CHB and of IL-4 in CHB triggered the functional defects in monocytes via induction of beta-catenin. Additionally, monocyte-derived M1 macrophages of CHB/IT produced fewer proinflammatory and more anti-inflammatory cytokines than those of IC/HC, while in CHB/IT, the monocytes skewed the differentiation of CD4+ T cells more toward regulatory T cells and a Th2 phenotype. Moreover, monocytes in CHB and IT overexpressed chemokine receptor CCR2, which coincided with increased intrahepatic accumulation of beta-catenin+ CD14+ cells. One year of tenofovir therapy failed to normalize monocyte functions or reduce serum HBsAg/IL-4 levels. Taken together, monocytes are functionally perturbed mostly in IT and EP-/EN-CHB phases. Targeting intramonocytic beta-catenin or reducing HBsAg/IL-4 levels might restore monocyte function and facilitate viral clearance. IMPORTANCE Chronic HBV infection (CHI) is a major cause of end-stage liver disease for which pharmacological treatments currently available are inadequate. Chronically HBV-infected patients fail to mount an efficient immune response to the virus, impeding viral clearance and recovery from hepatitis. Monocytes represent a central part of innate immunity, but a comprehensive understanding on monocyte involvement in CHI is still lacking. We here report a multitude of defects in monocytes in chronically HBV-infected patients that include alteration in subset distribution, Toll-like receptor expression, cytokine production, phagocytic activity, oxidative response, migratory ability, polarization of monocyte-derived macrophages, and monocyte-T-cell interaction. We demonstrated that high levels of hepatitis B virus surface antigen and IL-4 potentiate these defects in monocytes via beta-catenin induction while therapy with the nucleotide analog tenofovir fails to restore monocyte function. Our findings add to the continuing effort to devise new immunotherapeutic strategies that could reverse the immune defects in CHI.", "pmid": "36445121"}

Cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate are common adjuvant chemotherapy drugs for treatment of osteosarcoma, but multidrug resistance is a growing problem. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance in osteosarcoma cells is crucial for developing new therapeutic approaches and ultimately improving the prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. To identify genes associated with cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma, we screened a large-scale mutant library generated by transfecting human osteosarcoma cells with a piggyBac (PB) transposon-based gene activation vector. Several candidate genes were identified by using Splinkerette-PCR paired with Next Generation Sequencing. We created a disease-free survival predictor model, which includes ZNF720, REEP3, CNNM2, and CGREF1, using TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments) datasets. Additionally, the results of our enrichment analysis between the Four_genes_high group and Low_group suggested that these four genes may participate in cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma through cross talk between various signaling pathways, especially the signaling pathway related to bone formation. These data may help guide future studies into chemotherapy for osteosarcoma.", "pmid": "36408691"}
{"abstract_id": "1003", "title": "Anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody interference with blood compatibility testing: Differentiating isatuximab and daratumumab via functional epitope mapping.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are two FDA-approved anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies for treatment of multiple myeloma: isatuximab and daratumumab. Owing to expression of CD38 on reagent red blood cells (RBCs), these antibodies interfere with indirect antiglobulin tests (IATs). We sought to understand differences in such interference by performing binding experiments. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In vitro experiments to compare the binding to RBCs of isatuximab and daratumumab alone or in the presence of a mouse anti-human CD38 antibody (HB-7 or AT13/5) or a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-analog CD38 inhibitor were performed and quantified by flow cytometry, imaging, mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and LigandTracer technologies. Serologic testing was performed on plasma samples spiked with isatuximab or daratumumab. RESULTS: CD38 expressed on RBCs can be directly bound by daratumumab, whereas isatuximab requires a co-factor, such as HB-7, AT13/5, or a CD38 inhibitor, suggesting that the isatuximab epitope on RBCs is masked in vitro. Daratumumab samples more frequently showed interference and had stronger reactions than isatuximab samples. Dithiothreitol treatment was equally effective in mitigating the interference caused by either drug. DISCUSSION: Both isatuximab and daratumumab interfere with IATs but at different magnitudes, reflecting distinct binding to CD38 on RBCs. From the binding studies, we conclude that the isatuximab epitope on RBCs is masked in vitro and binding requires a certain CD38 conformation or co-factor. This circumstance may explain why interference is seen only in a subset of patients receiving isatuximab when compared with interference seen in most patients on daratumumab therapy.", "pmid": "36239134"}

However, the deficiency of endogenous H2O2 and high concentration of glutathione (GSH) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) weaken the CDT-based tumor-therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a photothermal-enhanced tumor-specific cascade catalytic nanosystem has been constructed on the basis of glucose oxidase (GOD)-functionalized molybdenum (Mo)-based polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, termed as GOD@POMs. METHODS: GOD@POMs were synthesized by a facile one-pot procedure and covalently conjugation. Then, its structure was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption spectrum and infrared thermal camera were applied to evaluate the catalytic and photothermal performance, respectively. Moreover, to confirm the therapeutic effects in vitro, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, live/dead staining and ROS staining were performed. Furthermore, the biosafety of GOD@POMs was investigated via blood routine, blood biochemistry and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining in Kunming mice. Besides, the C6 glioma tumor-bearing mice were constructed to evaluate its anti-tumor effects in vivo and its photoacoustic (PA) imaging capability. Notably, RNA sequencing, H&E, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Ki-67 staining were also conducted to disclose its underlying anti-tumor mechanism. RESULTS: In this multifunctional nanosystem, GOD can effectively catalyze the oxidation of intratumoral glucose into gluconic acid and H2O2, achieving the cancer starvation therapy. Meanwhile, the generated gluconic acid decreases the pH in TME resulting in POM aggregation, which enables PA imaging-guided tumor-specific photothermal therapy (PTT), especially in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) biological window. Importantly, the Mo (VI) sites on POM can be reduced to Mo (V) active sites in accompany with GSH depletion, and then the post-produced Mo (V) transforms in situ overproduced H2O2 into singlet oxygen (1O2) via Russell mechanism, achieving self-enhanced CDT. Moreover, the PTT-triggered local tumor temperature elevation augments the synergistic nanocatalytic-therapeutic efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, the integration of GOD-induced starvation therapy, H2O2 self-supply/GSH-depletion enhanced Mo-based CDT, and POM aggregation-mediated PTT endow the GOD@POMs with remarkable synergistic anticancer outcomes with neglectable adverse effects.", "pmid": "36435848"}

Transition-state analysis and kinetic studies have described the mechanism of AdoMet and triphosphate formation at the catalytic site. Hydrolysis of triphosphate to pyrophosphate and phosphate by MAT2A is required for product release and proceeds through a second chemical transition state. Crystal structures of MAT2A with analogues of AdoMet and pyrophosphate were obtained in the presence of Mg2+, Al3+, and F-. MgF3- is trapped as a PO3- mimic in a structure with malonate filling the pyrophosphate site. NMR demonstrates that MgF3- and AlF30 are bound by MAT2A as mimics of the departing phosphoryl group. Crystallographic analysis reveals a planar MgF3- acting to mimic a phosphoryl (PO3-) leaving group. The modeled transition state with PO3- has the phosphorus atom sandwiched symmetrically and equidistant (approximately 2 A) between a pyrophosphate oxygen and the water nucleophile. A catalytic site arginine directs the nucleophilic water to the phosphoryl leaving group. The catalytic geometry of the transition-state reconstruction predicts a loose transition state with characteristics of symmetric nucleophilic displacement.", "pmid": "34668717"}

Since no specific therapeutic drugs for treating COVID-19 have been approved by FDA, recent studies suggest that the known antimalarial quinine and its derivatives (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) inhibit receptor binding of the viral particles and inhibits the strong \"cytokine storm\", which is the main cause of death among infected patients. In particular, the natural alkaloid quinine has shown to possess a better safety profile and greater tolerability compared to its derivatives. Dosage optimization of quinine is still necessary as the currently available dosage forms have controversial pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. Therefore, repurposing quinine dosage forms to improve its pharmacokinetics and safety profile may be necessary to support its use against SARS-CoV-2.

Analysis of the S. cerevisiae and human homologs have only identified an interaction between the Msh2 connector domain and Mlh1.

Plasma metabolites can provide insights into underlying processes associated with CKD. OBJECTIVES: To clarify the relationship of plasma metabolites with CKD and renal function in human. METHODS: We used a targeted metabolomics approach to characterize the relationship of 450 plasma metabolites with CKD and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in 616 adults, aged 38-94 years, who participated in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. RESULTS: There were 74 (12.0%) adults with CKD. Carnitine, acetylcarnitine, propionylcarnitine, butyrylcarnitine, trigonelline, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), 1-methylhistidine, citrulline, homoarginine, homocysteine, sarcosine, symmetric dimethylarginine, aspartate, phenylalanine, taurodeoxycholic acid, 3-indolepropionic acid, phosphatidylcholines (PC).aa.C40:2, PC.aa.C40:3, PC.ae.C40:6, triglycerides (TG) 20:4/36:3, TG 20:4/36:4, and choline were associated with higher odds of CKD in multivariable analyses adjusting for potential confounders and using a false discovery rate (FDR) to address multiple testing. Six acylcarnitines, trigonelline, TMAO, 18 amino acids and biogenic amines, taurodeoxycholic acid, hexoses, cholesteryl esters 22:6, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, 3-indolepropionic acid, 2 PCs, 17 TGs, and choline were negatively associated with eGFR, and hippuric acid was positively associated with eGFR in multivariable analyses adjusting for potential confounders and using a FDR approach. CONCLUSION: The metabolites associated with CKD and reduced eGFR suggest that several pathways, such as the urea cycle, the arginine-nitric oxide pathway, the polyamine pathway, and short chain acylcarnitine metabolism are altered in adults with CKD and impaired renal function.", "pmid": "33428023"}

VEN and HMA treatment can result in prolonged and often profound neutropenia, and this warrants antifungal prophylaxis. Azole antifungals inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4, the primary enzyme responsible for VEN metabolism; this results in VEN dose reductions for each concomitant antifungal. Limited clinical data exist on outcomes for patients treated with VEN, an HMA, and various azoles. METHODS: The time to neutrophil recovery (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] > 1000 cells/mm3 ) and platelet (PLT) recovery (PLT count > 100,000 cells/mm3 ) in 64 patients with newly diagnosed AML who achieved a response after course 1 of VEN plus an HMA were evaluated. HMA therapy included azacitidine (75 mg/m2 intravenously/subcutaneously for 7 days) or decitabine (20 mg/m2 intravenously for 5 or 10 days). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (73%) received an azole: posaconazole (n = 17; 27%), voriconazole (n = 9; 14%), isavuconazole (n = 20; 31%), or fluconazole (n = 1; 2%). The median time to ANC recovery were similar for patients who did receive an azole (37 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 34-38 days) and patients who did not receive an azole (39 days; 95% CI, 30 days to not estimable; P = .8). The median time to PLT recovery was significantly longer for patients receiving azoles (28 vs 22 days; P = .01). The median times to ANC recovery (35 vs 38 days) and PLT recovery (26 vs 32 days) were similar with posaconazole and voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS: VEN plus an HMA resulted in neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, with the latter prolonged in patients receiving concomitant azoles. Concomitant posaconazole or voriconazole and VEN (100 mg) resulted in similar ANC and PLT recovery times, suggesting the safety of these dosage combinations during course 1.", "pmid": "33793970"}

They require stabilization by microtubule minus-end-targeting proteins including the CAMSAP family of molecules. Using exome sequencing on samples from five unrelated families, we show that bi-allelic CAMSAP1 loss-of-function variants cause a clinically recognizable, syndromic neuronal migration disorder. The cardinal clinical features of the syndrome include a characteristic craniofacial appearance, primary microcephaly, severe neurodevelopmental delay, cortical visual impairment, and seizures. The neuroradiological phenotype comprises a highly recognizable combination of classic lissencephaly with a posterior more severe than anterior gradient similar to PAFAH1B1(LIS1)-related lissencephaly and severe hypoplasia or absence of the corpus callosum; dysplasia of the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and midbrain; and cerebellar hypodysplasia, similar to the tubulinopathies, a group of monogenic tubulin-associated disorders of cortical dysgenesis. Neural cell rosette lineages derived from affected individuals displayed findings consistent with these phenotypes, including abnormal morphology, decreased cell proliferation, and neuronal differentiation. Camsap1-null mice displayed increased perinatal mortality, and RNAScope studies identified high expression levels in the brain throughout neurogenesis and in facial structures, consistent with the mouse and human neurodevelopmental and craniofacial phenotypes. Together our findings confirm a fundamental role of CAMSAP1 in neuronal migration and brain development and define bi-allelic variants as a cause of a clinically distinct neurodevelopmental disorder in humans and mice.", "pmid": "36283405"}

However, the oncogenic potential of SF3B4 in lung cancer has not yet been determined. The in vivo expression profiles of SF3B4 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from publicly available data revealed a significant increase in SF3B4 expression in tumor tissues compared to that in normal tissues. The impact of SF3B4 deletion on the growth of NSCLC cells was determined using a siRNA strategy in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. SF3B4 silencing resulted in marked retardation of the A549 cell proliferation, accompanied by the accumulation of cells at the G0/G1 phase and increased expression of p27, p21, and p53. Double knockdown of SF3B4 and p53 resulted in the restoration of p21 expression and partial recovery of cell proliferation, indicating that the p53/p21 axis is involved, at least in part, in the SF3B4-mediated regulation of A549 cell proliferation. We also provided ubiquitination factor E4B (UBE4B) is essential for p53 accumulation after SF3B4 depletion based on followings. First, co-immunoprecipitation showed that SF3B4 interacts with UBE4B. Furthermore, UBE4B levels were decreased by SF3B4 depletion. UBE4B depletion, in turn, reproduced the outcome of SF3B4 depletion, including reduction of polyubiquitinated p53 levels, subsequent induction of p53/p21 and p27, and proliferation retardation. Collectively, our findings indicate the important role of SF3B4 in the regulation of A549 cell proliferation through the UBE4B/p53/p21 axis and p27, implicating the therapeutic strategies for NSCLC targeting SF3B4 and UBE4B.", "pmid": "35996826"}

LTL, inflammation, OxS markers (at baseline and after 4 years of follow-up) and SIRT1-Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs7069102 and rs1885472) were determined in patients from the CORDIOPREV study. We analyzed the genotype-marker interactions and the effect of diet on these interactions. Regardless of the diet, we observed LTL maintenance in GG-carriers for the rs7069102, in contrast to carriers of the minor C allele, where it decreased after follow-up (p = 0.001). The GG-carriers showed an increase in reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio (p = 0.003), lower lipid peroxidation products (LPO) levels (p < 0.001) and a greater decrease in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels (p < 0.001) after follow-up. After the LF diet intervention, the GG-carriers showed stabilization in LTL which was significant compared to the C allele subjects (p = 0.037), although the protective effects found for inflammation and OxS markers remained significant after follow-up with the two diets. Patients who are homozygous for the SIRT1-SNP rs7069102 (the most common genotype) may benefit from healthy diets, as suggested by improvements in OxS and inflammation in patients with CHD, which may indicate the slowing-down of the aging process and its related diseases.", "pmid": "36145164"}

NiO aerogels were synthesized using methanol and 2-methoxy-ethanol (MeGl) as sol solvents. SCD was performed using iso-propanol, methanol and tert-butyl-methyl ether as supercritical fluids. The obtained samples were characterized using low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction analysis, mass-spectra analysis and STEM and TEM methods. It was found that specific surface area and the phase and chemical composition strongly depend on the synthesis conditions. We revealed that Ni2+ cations were reduced into Ni0 when 2-methoxy-ethanol was applied as a sol solvent. The mechanism of the Ni2+ cations reduction is proposed. We consider that at the stage of sol preparation, the Ni2+-MeGl chelate was formed. This chelate decomposes at the SCD stage with the release of MeGl, which, in turn, eliminates methanol and leads to the formation of aldehyde. The latter is responsible for the nickel reduction. The proposed mechanism was confirmed experimentally.", "pmid": "36432319"}

Although a few studies have examined its resistance mechanisms, no effective treatment strategy has yet been proposed for patients with this mutation. Here, we report an effective treatment strategy for the rare EGFR L718Q mutation for the first time. A 44-year-old Chinese male patient initially presented with the sensitizing EGFR L858R mutation, and the progression-free survival (PFS) time after initial icotinib treatment was 9 months. When the progression of the disease (PD) and the EGFR T790M mutation were identified, he did not respond to the osimertinib treatment. Through comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the surgical specimen, the rare EGFR L718Q mutation was eventually identified as having a frequency of 68.84%, together with an EGFR amplification with a copy number of 11.54. The previous treatment response was retrospectively explained, and the patient faced the challenge of not being able to benefit from any targeted therapy. Following chemotherapy with a personalized regimen which effectively modified the proportion of sensitive and resistant cells, significant response to osimertinib re-challenge was observed, and another PFS of 4.7 months was achieved.

The present study aimed to identify the role of cholesterol metabolism in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell response to cisplatin (CDDP) treatment in the acute setting and in a model of CDDP resistance. METHODS: MCF-7 (luminal A), MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative) and CDDP-resistant MDA-MB-231 (MDACR) cell lines were grown in the presence or absence of CDDP in combination with atorvastatin (ATV), lipid depletion or low-density lipoprotein loading and were analyzed by a variety of biochemical and radiometric techniques. RESULTS: Co-administration of CDDP and ATV strongly reduced cell proliferation and viability to a greater extent than CDDP alone, especially in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings were associated with reduced cholesteryl ester synthesis and storage in MDA-MB-231 cells. In MDACR cells, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT-1) was upregulated compared to naive MDA-MB-231 cells and ATV treatment restored CDDP sensitivity, suggesting that aberrant ACAT-1 expression and associated changes in cholesterol metabolism contribute to CDDP resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the elevated susceptibility of MDA-MB-231 cells to co-administration of CDDP and ATV, is associated with an increased reliance on cholesteryl ester availability. Our data from these cell culture-based studies identifies altered cholesterol homeostasis as an adaptive response to CDDP treatment that contributes to aggressiveness and chemotherapy resistance.", "pmid": "36481936"}

We previously developed the WBPH-resistant rice cultivar \"OxF3H\" by overexpressing the OsF3H gene. Although there was a higher accumulation of the flavonoids kaempferol (Kr) and quercetin (Qu) as well as salicylic acid (SA) in OxF3H transgenic (OsF3H or Trans) plants compared to the wild type (WT), it is still unclear how OsF3H overexpression affects these WBPH resistant-related changes in gene expression in OxF3H plants. In this study, we analyze RNA-seq data from OxF3H and WT at several points (0 h, 3 h, 12 h, and 24 h) after WBPH infection to explain how overall changes in gene expression happen in these two cultivars. RT-qPCR further validated a number of the genes. Results revealed that the highest number of DEGs (4735) between the two genotypes was detected after 24 h of infection. Interestingly, it was found that several of the DEGs between the WT and OsF3H under control conditions were also differentially expressed in OsF3H in response to WBPH infestation. These results indicate that significant differences in gene expression between the \"OxF3H\" and \"WT\" exist as the infection time increases. Many of these DEGs were related to oxidoreductase activity, response to stress, salicylic acid biosynthesis, metabolic process, defense response to pathogen, cellular response to toxic substance, and regulation of hormone levels. Moreover, genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (Et) biosynthesis were upregulated in OxF3H plants, while jasmonic acid (JA), brassinosteroid (Br), and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways were found downregulated in OxF3H plants during WBPH infestation. Interestingly, many DEGs related to pathogenesis, such as OsPR1, OsPR1b, OsNPR1, OsNPR3, and OsNPR5, were found to be significantly upregulated in OxF3H plants. Additionally, genes related to the MAPKs pathway and about 30 WRKY genes involved in different pathways were upregulated in OxF3H plants after WBPH infestation. This suggests that overexpression of the OxF3H gene leads to multiple transcriptomic changes and impacts plant hormones and pathogenic-related and secondary-metabolites-related genes, enhancing the plant's resistance to WBPH infestation.", "pmid": "36499636"}

Metformin, a hypoglycemic drug, has been reported to have beneficial effects on maintaining bone health. However, the role and underlying mechanism of metformin in ovariectomized (OVX)-induced bone loss is still vague. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that metformin administration alleviated bone loss in postmenopausal women and ovariectomized mice, based on reduced bone resorption markers, increased bone mineral density (BMD) and improvement of bone microstructure. Then, osteoclast precursors administered metformin in vitro and in vivo were collected to examine the differentiation potential and autophagical level. The mechanism was investigated by infection with lentivirus-mediated BNIP3 or E2F1 overexpression. We observed a dramatical inhibition of autophagosome synthesis and osteoclast formation and activity. Treatment with RAPA, an autophagy activator, abrogated the metformin-mediated autophagy downregulation and inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Additionally, overexpression of E2F1 demonstrated that reduction of OVX-upregulated autophagy mediated by metformin was E2F1 dependent. Mechanistically, metformin-mediated downregulation of E2F1 in ovariectomized mice could downregulate BECN1 and BNIP3 levels, which subsequently perturbed the binding of BECN1 to BCL2. Furthermore, the disconnect between BECN1 and BCL2 was shown by BNIP3 overexpression. CONCLUSION: In summary, we demonstrated the effect and underlying mechanism of metformin on OVX-induced bone loss, which could be, at least in part, ascribed to its role in downregulating autophagy during osteoclastogenesis via E2F1-dependent BECN1 and BCL2 downregulation, suggesting that metformin or E2F1 inhibitor is a potential agent against postmenopausal bone loss.

Although perturbation of inositol homeostasis has been implicated in numerous human disorders, surprisingly little is known about how inositol levels are regulated in mammalian cells. A recent study in mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that nuclear translocation of inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) mediates repression of myo-inositol-3-P synthase (MIPS), the rate-limiting inositol biosynthetic enzyme. Binding of IP6K1 to phosphatidic acid (PA) is required for this repression. Here, we elucidate the role of PA in IP6K1 repression. Our results indicate that increasing PA levels through pharmacological stimulation of phospholipase D (PLD) or direct supplementation of 18:1 PA induces nuclear translocation of IP6K1 and represses expression of the MIPS protein. We found that this effect was specific to PA synthesized in the plasma membrane, as endoplasmic reticulum-derived PA did not induce IP6K1 translocation. Furthermore, we determined that PLD-mediated PA synthesis can be stimulated by the master metabolic regulator 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We show that activation of AMPK by glucose deprivation or by treatment with the mood-stabilizing drugs valproate or lithium recapitulated IP6K1 nuclear translocation and decreased MIPS expression. This study demonstrates for the first time that modulation of PA levels through the AMPK-PLD pathway regulates IP6K1-mediated repression of MIPS.", "pmid": "35963434"}

The chronic mild stress rat model was prepared using the known protocols. The results from open-field test showed that rats in the chronic mild stress group scored very low in terms of crossings and rearings than those of the normal rats. However, pre-treatment of the rats with 10 mg/kg doses of 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin prevented decline in the locomotor activity by chronic mild stress. The level of monoamine oxidase-A in the chronic mild stress rat hippocampus was markedly higher. Chronic mild stress induced increase in the monoamine oxidase-A level was inhibited by pre-treatment with 10 mg/kg doses of 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin in the rats. Chronic mild stress caused a marked increase in the level of caspase-3 mRNA and proteins in rat hippocampus tissues. The increased level of caspase-3 mRNA and protein level was inhibited by treatment of rats with 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin (10 mg/kg). 5,7-Dimethoxycoumarin administration into the rats caused a marked increase in the levels of heat shock protein-70 mRNA and protein. The levels of heat shock protein-70 were markedly lower both in normal and chronic mild stress groups of rats compared to the 5,7-dimethoxycoumarin treated groups.

Here, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms for the tumour-promoting effect in dying cells and for tumour repopulation in surviving tongue cancer cells. METHODS: Tumour repopulation in vitro and in vivo was represented by luciferase activities. The differentially expressed cytokines in the conditioned medium (CM) were identified using a cytokine array. Gain or loss of function was investigated using inhibitors, neutralising antibodies, shRNAs and ectopic overexpression strategies. RESULTS: We found that dying tumour cells undergoing cytotoxic therapy increase the growth of living tongue cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Dying tumour cells create amphiregulin (AREG)- and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-based extracellular environments via cytotoxic treatment-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress. This environment stimulates growth by activating lysine acetyltransferase 6B (KAT6B)-dependent nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signalling in living tumour cells. As direct targets of NF-kappaB, miR-22 targets KAT6B to repress its expression, but long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) (XLOC_003973 and XLOC_010383) counter the effect of miR-22 to enhance KAT6B expression. Moreover, we detected increased AREG and bFGF protein levels in the blood of tongue cancer patients with X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) activation in tumours under cytotoxic therapy and found that XBP1 activation is associated with poor prognosis of patients. We also detected activation of miR-22/lncRNA/KAT6B/NF-kappaB signalling in recurrent cancers compared to paired primary tongue cancers.

Moreover, TRIM22 forms a complex with cytosolic purine 5-nucleotidase (NT5C2) in GBM and regulates the ubiquitination of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I). TRIM22 promotes the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, while NT5C2 is responsible for K48-linked ubiquitination. This regulation directly affects the RIG-I/NF-kappaB/cell division cycle and apoptosis regulator protein 1 (CCAR1) signaling axis. Ubiquitin modification inhibitor of RIG-I restores the inhibition of tumor growth induced by TRIM22 knockout. The follow-up results showed that compared with patients with high TRIM22 expression, patients with low TRIM22 expression had a longer survival time and were more sensitive to treatment with TMZ. Our results revealed that the TRIM22-NT5C2 complex orchestrates the proliferation of GBM and benefits of TMZ through post-translational modification of RIG-I and the regulation of the RIG-I/NF-kappaB/CCAR1 pathway and is a promising target for single-pathway multi-target therapy.", "pmid": "36159777"}

Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP) is an edible and medicinal herb used as a component of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approach to treating COVID-19 in China. However, the material basis and related mechanistic research regarding this herb for the treatment of COVID-19 are still unclear. First, a wide-targeted UPLC-ESI-MS/MS-based comparative metabolomics analysis was conducted to screen for the active metabolites of CRP. Second, network pharmacology was used to uncover the initial linkages among these metabolites, their possible targets, and COVID-19. Each metabolite was then further studied via molecular docking with the identified potential SARS-CoV-2 targets 3CL hydrolase, host cell target angiotensin-converting enzyme II, spike protein, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Finally, the most potential small molecule compound was verified by in vitro and in vivo experiments, and the mechanism of its treatment of COVID-19 was further explored. In total, 399 metabolites were identified and nine upregulated differential metabolites were screened out as potential key active metabolites, among which isorhamnetin have anti-inflammatory activity in vitro validation assays. In addition, the molecular docking results also showed that isorhamnetin had a good binding ability with the key targets of COVID-19. Furthermore, in vivo results showed that isorhamnetin could significantly reduced the lung pathological injury and inflammatory injury by regulating ATK1, EGFR, MAPK8, and MAPK14 to involve in TNF signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, and T cell receptor signaling pathway. Our results indicated that isorhamnetin, as screened from CRP, may have great potential for use in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. This study has also demonstrated that comparative metabolomics combined with network pharmacology strategy could be used as an effective approach for discovering potential compounds in herbal medicines that are effective against COVID-19.", "pmid": "36506534"}

It is paramount to identify interventions to improve physical health in this population. METHODS: Umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on pharmacological/non-pharmacological interventions for physical health outcomes/intolerability-related discontinuation in mood disorders (any age). RESULTS: Ninety-seven meta-analyses were included. Among youths, against placebo, in depression, antidepressants/antipsychotics had higher discontinuation rates; in bipolar depression, olanzapine+fluoxetine worsened total cholesterol (TC)/triglycerides/weight gain (WG) (large ES). In adults with bipolar disorder, olanzapine worsened HbA1c/TC/WG (moderate/large ES); asenapine increased fasting glucose (small ES); quetiapine/cariprazine/risperidone induced WG (small/moderate ES). In bipolar depression, lurasidone was metabolically neutral. In depression, psychological interventions improved physical health-related quality of life (PHQoL) (small ES), fasting glucose/HbA1c (medium/large ES); SSRIs improved fasting glucose/HbA1c, readmission for coronary disease, pain (small ES); quetiapine/aripiprazole/olanzapine induced WG (small to large ES). Exercise improved cardiorespiratory fitness (moderate ES). In the elderly, fluoxetine yielded more detrimental cardiovascular effects than sertraline/escitalopram (large ES); antidepressants were neutral on exercise tolerance and PHQoL. In mixed age groups, in bipolar disorder aripiprazole was metabolically neutral; in depression, SSRIs lowered blood pressure versus placebo and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (small ES); brexpiprazole augmentation caused WG and was less tolerated (small ES); exercise improved PHQoL (moderate ES). CONCLUSIONS: Some interventions (psychological therapies, exercise and SSRIs) improve certain physical health outcomes in mood disorders, few are neutral, but various pharmacological interventions are associated with negative effects. Evidence from this umbrella review has limitations, should consider evidence from other disorders and should be integrated with recent evidence from individual RCTs, and observational evidence. Effective treatments with either beneficial or physically neutral profiles should be prioritized.", "pmid": "36138129"}
{"abstract_id": "1035", "title": "A plea for personalization of the hemodynamic management of septic shock.", "abstract": "Although guidelines provide excellent expert guidance for managing patients with septic shock, they leave room for personalization according to patients' condition. Hemodynamic monitoring depends on the evolution phase: salvage, optimization, stabilization, and de-escalation. Initially during the salvage phase, monitoring to identify shock etiology and severity should include arterial pressure and lactate measurements together with clinical examination, particularly skin mottling and capillary refill time. Low diastolic blood pressure may trigger vasopressor initiation. At this stage, echocardiography may be useful to identify significant cardiac dysfunction. During the optimization phase, echocardiographic monitoring should be pursued and completed by the assessment of tissue perfusion through central or mixed-venous oxygen saturation, lactate, and carbon dioxide veno-arterial gradient. Transpulmonary thermodilution and the pulmonary artery catheter should be considered in the most severe patients. Fluid therapy also depends on shock phases. While administered liberally during the resuscitation phase, fluid responsiveness should be assessed during the optimization phase. During stabilization, fluid infusion should be minimized. In the de-escalation phase, safe fluid withdrawal could be achieved by ensuring tissue perfusion is preserved. Norepinephrine is recommended as first-line vasopressor therapy, while vasopressin may be preferred in some patients. Essential questions remain regarding optimal vasopressor selection, combination therapy, and the most effective and safest escalation. Serum renin and the angiotensin I/II ratio may identify patients who benefit most from angiotensin II. The optimal therapeutic strategy for shock requiring high-dose vasopressors is scant. In all cases, vasopressor therapy should be individualized, based on clinical evaluation and blood flow measurements to avoid excessive vasoconstriction. Inotropes should be considered in patients with decreased cardiac contractility associated with impaired tissue perfusion. Based on pharmacologic properties, we suggest as the first test a limited dose of dobutamine, to add enoximone or milrinone in the second line and substitute or add levosimendan if inefficient. Regarding adjunctive therapies, while hydrocortisone is nowadays advised in patients receiving high doses of vasopressors, patients responding to corticosteroids may be identified in the future by the analysis of selected cytokines or specific transcriptomic endotypes. To conclude, although some general rules apply for shock management, a personalized approach should be considered for hemodynamic monitoring and support.", "pmid": "36457089"}

After an indefinite number of divisions, pluripotent cells differentiate into various types of cells. Nuclear factor I (NFI) transcription factors are known as crucial regulators in various organ development and stem cell biology. Among its members, nuclear factor I-C (NFI-C) has been reported to play an essential role in odontogenesis. Nfic knockout mice show malformation in all mineralized tissues, but it remains unclear which stage of development Nfic is involved in. We previously reported that Nfic induces the differentiation of ameloblast, odontoblast, and osteoblast. However, the question remains whether Nfic participates in the late stage of development, perpetuating the proliferation of stem cells. This study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of NFI-C function in stem cells capable of forming hard tissues. Here, we demonstrate that Nfic regulates Sox2 and cell proliferation in diverse mineralized tissue stem cells such as dental epithelial stem cells (DESCs), dental pulp stem cells, and bone marrow stem cells, but not in fibroblasts. It was also involved in the expression of pluripotency genes Lin28 and NANOG. Especially in DESCs, Nfic regulates the proliferation of epithelial cells via epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, which are the Fgf8-Nfic-Sox2 pathway in epithelium and Nfic-Fgf10 in the mesenchyme. Moreover, Nfic slightly increased reprogramming efficiency in induced pluripotent stem cells of mineralized tissues, but not in soft tissues. In conclusion, these results suggest that Nfic is a crucial factor for maintaining the stem cell niche of mineralized tissues and provides a possibility for Nfic as an additional factor in improving reprogramming efficiency.", "pmid": "36213683"}

Improving the sensitivity of osteosarcoma to chemotherapy is urgently needed to improve patient survival. We found that chemotherapy triggered apoptosis of human osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo; this was accompanied by increased Sestrin2 expression. Importantly, autophagy was also enhanced with increased Sestrin2 expression. Based on this observation, we explored the potential role of Sestrin2 in autophagy of osteosarcoma. We found that Sestrin2 inhibited osteosarcoma cell apoptosis by promoting autophagy via inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and this process is closely related to the PERK-eIF2alpha-CHOP pathway. In addition, our study showed that low Sestrin2 expression can effectively reduce autophagy of human osteosarcoma cells after chemotherapy, increase p-mTOR expression, decrease Bcl-2 expression, promote osteosarcoma cell apoptosis, and slow down tumour progression in NU/NU mice. Sestrin2 activates autophagy by inhibiting mTOR via the PERK-eIF2alpha-CHOP pathway and inhibits apoptosis via Bcl-2. Therefore, our results explain one underlying mechanism of increasing the sensitivity of osteosarcoma to chemotherapy and suggest that Sestrin2 is a promising gene target.", "pmid": "34646824"}

Baseline and longitudinal values were used to build a linear mixed effect model (LME) and define different clusters. The development of the LME model in the derivation cohort of 17 HD patients (66.7 +- 12.3 years, eight males) allowed the characterization of two clusters (cl1 and cl2). Patients in cl1 presented a prevalence of females, higher lymphocyte count, and lower levels of lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and CD8 + T memory stem cells as a possible result of a milder inflammation. Then, this model was tested in an independent validation cohort of 30 HD patients (73.3 +- 16.3 years, 16 males) assigned to cl1 or cl2 (16 and 14 patients, respectively). The cluster comparison confirmed that cl1 presented a milder form of COVID-19 associated with reduced disease activity, hospitalization, mortality rate, and oxygen requirement.

Clot formation is promoted via cAMP-mediated secretion of von Willebrand factor (vWF), which fine-tunes the process of hemostasis. The exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular cAMP receptor that plays a regulatory role in suppressing inflammation. To assess whether EPAC could regulate vWF release during inflammation, we utilized our EPAC1-null mouse model and revealed increased secretion of vWF in endotoxemic mice in the absence of the EPAC1 gene. Pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 in vitro mimicked the EPAC1-/- phenotype. In addition, EPAC1 regulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha-triggered vWF secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a manner dependent upon inflammatory effector molecules PI3K and endothelial nitric oxide synthase.

Lrrk1 KO mice exhibit severe osteopetrosis caused by dysfunction of multinucleated osteoclasts, reduced bone resorption in endocortical and trabecular regions, and increased bone mineralization. Lrrk1 KO mice have lifelong accumulation of bone and respond normally to the anabolic actions of teriparatide treatment, but are resistant to ovariectomy-induced bone boss. Precursors derived from Lrrk1 KO mice differentiate into multinucleated cells in response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)/receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) treatment, but these cells fail to form peripheral sealing zones and ruffled borders, and fail to resorb bone. The phosphorylation of cellular Rous sarcoma oncogene (c-Src) at Tyr-527 is significantly elevated whereas at Tyr-416 is decreased in Lrrk1-deficient osteoclasts. The defective osteoclast function is partially rescued by overexpression of the constitutively active form of Y527F c-Src. Immunoprecipitation assays in osteoclasts detected a physical interaction of Lrrk1 with C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). Lrrk2 KO mice do not show obvious bone phenotypes. Precursors derived from Lrrk2 KO mice differentiate into functional multinucleated osteoclasts.

Increased PAD4 activity promotes the onset and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to evaluate the association of PADI4 haplotypes with RA risk, mRNA expression, and the PAD4 activity in patients with RA from Mexico. METHODOLOGY: 100 RA patients and 100 control subjects (CS) were included. Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP method, PADI4 mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR, the contribution of PADI4 alleles (PADI4_89 G>A, PADI4_90 T>C, and PADI4_92 G>C) to mRNA expression by the ASTQ method, and PAD4 activity by HPLC. Also, the anti-CCP and anti-PADI4 antibodies were quantified by ELISA. RESULTS: The three PADI4 polymorphisms were associated with RA susceptibility (OR = 1.72, p = 0.005; OR = 1.62; p = 0.014; OR = 1.69; p = 0.009; respectively).

To assess the chemotherapeutic potential of 15d-PMJ2, the current study sought to uncover molecular pathways by which 15d-PMJ2 exerts its antitumor activity. B16F10 melanoma and JWF2 squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were cultured in the presence of pharmacological agents that prevent ER or oxidative stress as well as Ca2+ channel blockers to identify mechanisms of 15d-PMJ2 cell death. Our data demonstrated the ER stress protein, PERK, was required for 15d-PMJ2-induced death. PERK activation triggered the release of ER-resident Ca2+ through an IP3R sensitive pathway. Increased calcium mobilization led to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload followed by mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and the deterioration of mitochondrial respiration.

In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced psychosis.

We determined whether there is a distinct lipid signature associated with chronic pain and its co-occurrence with obesity in adolescents. METHODS: We performed global lipidomics in serum samples from female adolescents (N = 67, 13-17 years old) with no pain/healthy weight (Controls), chronic pain/healthy weight (Pain Non-obese), no pain/obesity (Obese), or chronic pain/obesity (Pain Obese).

CAVD initiates with endothelial dysfunction, leading to lipid accumulation, inflammation, and osteogenic transformation. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) participates in the progression of cardiovascular diseases, such as endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. However, ILK role in CAVD is unknown. First, we determined that ILK expression is downregulated in aortic valves from patients with CAVD compared to non-CAVD, especially at the valve endothelium, and negatively correlated with calcification markers. Silencing ILK expression in human valve endothelial cells (siILK-hVECs) induced endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and promoted a switch to an osteoblastic phenotype; SiILK-hVECs expressed increased RUNX2 and developed calcified nodules. siILK-hVECs exhibited decreased NO production and increased nitrosative stress, suggesting valvular endothelial dysfunction. NO treatment of siILK-hVECs prevented VEC transdifferentiation, while treatment with an eNOS inhibitor mimicked ILK-silencing induction of EndMT. Accordingly, NO treatment inhibited VEC calcification. Mechanistically, siILK-hVECs showed increased Smad2 phosphorylation, suggesting a TGF-beta-dependent mechanism, and NO treatment decreased Smad2 activation and RUNX2. Experiments performed in eNOS KO mice confirmed the involvement of the ILK-eNOS signaling pathway in valve calcification, since aortic valves from these animals showed decreased ILK expression, increased RUNX2, and calcification.

RESULTS: Real-time PCR demonstrated that SOX2OT expression was up-regulated in glioma tissues and GSCs. Knockdown of SOX2OT inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GSCs, and promoted GSCs apoptosis. MiR-194-5p and miR-122 were down-regulated in human glioma tissues and GSCs, and miR-194-5p and miR-122 respectively exerted tumor-suppressive functions by inhibiting the proliferation, migration and invasion of GSCs, while promoting GSCs apoptosis. Knockdown of SOX2OT significantly increased the expression of miR-194-5p and miR-122 in GSCs. Dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that SOX2OT bound to both miR-194-5p and miR-122. SOX3 and TDGF-1 were up-regulated in human glioma tissues and GSCs. Knockdown of SOX3 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GSCs, promoted GSCs apoptosis, and decreased TDGF-1 mRNA and protein expression through direct binding to the TDGF-1 promoter. Over-expression of miR-194-5p and miR-122 decreased the mRNA and protein expression of SOX3 by targeting its 3'UTR. Knockdown of TDGF-1 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GSCs, promoted GSCs apoptosis, and inhibited the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Furthermore, SOX3 knockdown also inhibited the SOX2OT expression through direct binding to the SOX2OT promoter and formed a positive feedback loop. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate that the SOX2OT-miR-194-5p/miR-122-SOX3-TDGF-1 pathway forms a positive feedback loop and regulates the biological behaviors of GSCs, and these findings might provide a novel strategy for glioma treatment.", "pmid": "29132362"}

Cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of premature death. Frataxin functions in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, which are prosthetic groups that are found in proteins involved in many biological processes. To study the changes associated with decreased frataxin in human cardiomyocytes, we developed a novel isogenic model by acutely knocking down frataxin, post-differentiation, in cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Transcriptome analysis of four biological replicates identified severe mitochondrial dysfunction and a type I interferon response as the pathways most affected by frataxin knockdown. We confirmed that, in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, loss of frataxin leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. The type I interferon response was activated in multiple cell types following acute frataxin knockdown and was caused, at least in part, by release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol, activating the cGAS-STING sensor pathway.", "pmid": "36107856"}

The metastatic drivers of TNBCs are still poorly understood, and effective treatment non-existent. Here we reveal that the presence of Aurora-A Kinase (AURKA) in the nucleus and metastatic dissemination are molecularly connected through HIF1 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1) signaling. Nuclear AURKA activates transcription of \"hypoxia-induced genes\" under normoxic conditions (pseudohypoxia) and without upregulation of oxygen-sensitive HIF1A subunit. We uncover that AURKA preferentially binds to HIF1B and co-localizes with the HIF complex on DNA. The mass-spectrometry analysis of the AURKA complex further confirmed the presence of CBP and p300 along with other TFIIB/RNApol II components. Importantly, the expression of multiple HIF-dependent genes induced by nuclear AURKA (N-AURKA), including migration/invasion, survival/death, and stemness, promote early cancer dissemination. These results indicate that nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, AURKA is a novel driver of early metastasis. Analysis of clinical tumor specimens revealed a correlation between N-AURKA presence and decreased patient survival. Our results establish a mechanistic link between two critical pathways in cancer metastasis, identifying nuclear AURKA as a crucial upstream regulator of the HIF1 transcription complex and a target for anti-metastatic therapy.", "pmid": "34326467"}

Our objective was to examine the glucometabolic effects of HBO on whole-body glucose disposal in humans with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In a randomised placebo-controlled crossover trial located at the German Diabetes Center, 12 male individuals with type 2 diabetes (age 18-75 years, BMI <35 kg/m2, HbA1c 42-75 mmol/mol [6-9%]), randomly allocated by one person, underwent 2-h HBO, once with 100% (240 kPa; HBO) and once with 21% oxygen (240 kPa; control, CON). Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps with D-[6,6-2H2]glucose, hepatic and skeletal muscle energy metabolism were assessed by 1H/31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, while high-resolution respirometry measured skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue (WAT) mitochondrial capacity. All participants and people assessing the outcomes were blinded. RESULTS: HBO decreased fasting blood glucose by 19% and increased whole-body, hepatic and WAT insulin sensitivity about one-third (p<0.05 vs CON). Upon HBO, hepatic gamma-ATP concentrations doubled, mitochondrial respiratory control doubled in skeletal muscle and tripled in WAT (p<0.05 vs CON). HBO increased myocellular insulin-stimulated serine-473/threonine-308 phosphorylation of Akt but decreased basal inhibitory serine-1101 phosphorylation of IRS-1 and endoplasmic reticulum stress (p<0.05 vs CON). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: HBO-mediated improvement of insulin sensitivity likely results from decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress and increased mitochondrial capacity, possibly leading to low-dose reactive oxygen species-mediated mitohormesis in humans with type 2 diabetes.

This study aimed to clarify the clinico-pathological features and outcomes of GEA-positive thyroid nodules, which have not yet been well-described in the literature. A retrospective chart review was performed whereby patients were included if they underwent thyroid surgery between January 2018 and May 2022 at two McGill University teaching hospitals and their surgery was preceded by pre-operative molecular TsV3 testing. In total, 75 of the 328 patients with thyroid nodules (22.9%) who underwent molecular testing and surgery were GEA-positive. On surgical pathology, GEA-positive nodules showed a significantly higher malignancy rate compared to their GEA-negative counterparts (90.7% vs. 77.7%, respectively, p = 0.011). Among those that were malignant, 48.5% had at least one aggressive pathological feature, including histological subtype, extra-thyroidal extension, or lymph node metastasis. BRAF V600E mutation had a significantly greater association with aggressive malignant GEA-positive nodules compared to non-aggressive ones (p < 0.001).

Following HCT, sirolimus is an immunosuppressant used to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis and other antimicrobial agents (including acyclovir). One rare adverse event associated with both drugs is rhabdomyolysis, defined as creatine kinase (CK) elevation at least 5 to 10 times the upper limit of normal. This study was conducted to evaluate the rate of and risk factors for developing rhabdomyolysis in the post-HCT setting. Across 4 haploidentical and matched related donor (MRD) nonmyeloablative protocols, CK levels were prospectively monitored and patients were retrospectively identified for rhabdomyolysis. The rhabdomyolysis was graded based on the severity of CK elevation and other organ injury. At diagnosis, patients were queried for concurrent medication use (ie, sirolimus, TMP-SMX, acyclovir, or statins), sex, age, donor genotype, and time from transplantation. Among 127 patients with mostly SCD, rhabdomyolysis occurred in 22 (17%), including 2 recipients of haploidentical donor HCT and 20 recipients of MRD HCT. The time to the development of rhabdomyolysis was 61 and 73 days for the 2 recipients of haploidentical HCT and a median of 73 days for the MRD HCT recipients. Among the 22 patients who developed rhabdomyolysis, 20 (91%) were receiving sirolimus (2 haploidentical HCT recipients and 18 MRD HCT recipients), and 14 (64%) were also receiving TMP-SMX (all in the MRD HCT group). Seventy-five percent of the haploidentical donors and 69% of the MRDs had sickle cell trait. All but 2 patients with rhabdomyolysis were male. No patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were receiving statins at any point. Higher-than-expected rates of rhabdomyolysis were found post-transplantation for patients with SCD and beta-thalassemia.

We hypothesized that peptides derived from the binding domain of beta2-GPI would regulate angiogenesis and melanoma growth. In vitro analyses determined the peptides reduced endothelial cell migration and sFlt-1 secretion. In a syngeneic, immunocompetent mouse melanoma model, beta2-GPI-derived peptides also reduced melanoma growth in a dose-dependent response with increased sFlt-1 and attenuated vascular markers compared to negative controls.

More than 70 mutations have been identified in SLS patients, including small deletions or insertions, missense mutations, splicing defects and complex nucleotide changes. We now describe 2 SLS patients whose disease is caused by large contiguous gene deletions of the ALDH3A2 locus on 17p11.2. The deletions were defined using long distance inverse PCR and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. A 24-year-old SLS female was homozygous for a 352-kb deletion involving ALDH3A2 and 4 contiguous genes including ALDH3A1, which codes for the major soluble protein in cornea. Although lacking corneal disease, she showed severe symptoms of SLS with uncommon deterioration in oral motor function and loss of ambulation. The other 19-month-old female patient was a compound heterozygote for a 1.44-Mb contiguous gene deletion and a missense mutation (c.407C>T, P136L) in ALDH3A2. These studies suggest that large gene deletions may account for up to 5% of the mutant alleles in SLS. Geneticists should consider the possibility of compound heterozygosity for large deletions in patients with SLS and other inborn errors of metabolism, which has implications for carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.", "pmid": "21684788"}

The reasons for this are still largely unknown but could be accounted for by individual genetic variants, previous life events, or the kind of stressors. The human brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met variant, which was found to impair intracellular trafficking and activity-dependent secretion of BDNF, has been associated with increased susceptibility to develop several neuropsychiatric disorders, although there is still some controversial evidence. On the other hand, acute stress has been consistently demonstrated to promote the release of glutamate in cortico-limbic regions and altered glutamatergic transmission has been reported in psychiatric disorders. However, it is not known if the BDNF Val66Met single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affects the stress-induced presynaptic glutamate release. In this study, we exposed adult male BDNFVal/Val and BDNFVal/Met knock-in mice to 30 min of acute restraint stress. Plasma corticosterone levels, glutamate release, protein, and gene expression in the hippocampus were analyzed immediately after the end of the stress session. Acute restraint stress similarly increased plasma corticosterone levels and nuclear glucocorticoid receptor levels and phosphorylation in both BDNFVal/Val and BDNFVal/Met mice. However, acute restraint stress induced higher increases in hippocampal presynaptic release of glutamate, phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), and levels of the immediate early gene c-fos of BDNFVal/Met compared to BFNFVal/Val mice. Moreover, acute restraint stress selectively increased phosphorylation levels of synapsin I at Ser9 and at Ser603 in BDNFVal/Val and BDNFVal/Met mice, respectively. In conclusion, we report here that the BDNF Val66Met SNP knock-in mice display an altered response to acute restraint stress in terms of hippocampal glutamate release, CREB phosphorylation, and neuronal activation, compared to wild-type animals. Taken together, these results could partially explain the enhanced vulnerability to stressful events of Met carriers reported in both preclinical and clinical studies.", "pmid": "35908196"}

However, it is recognised that a significant side effect is cardiotoxicity; anthracyclines can cause irreversible damage to cardiac cells and ultimately impaired cardiac function and heart failure, which may only be evident years after exposure. The PROACT trial will establish the effectiveness of the ACE inhibitor enalapril maleate (enalapril) in preventing cardiotoxicity in patients with breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PROACT is a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded end-point, superiority trial which will recruit adult patients being treated for breast cancer and NHL at NHS hospitals throughout England. The trial aims to recruit 106 participants, who will be randomised to standard care (high-dose anthracycline-based chemotherapy) plus enalapril (intervention) or standard care alone (control). Patients randomised to the intervention arm will receive enalapril (starting at 2.5 mg two times per day and titrating up to a maximum dose of 10 mg two times per day), commencing treatment at least 2 days prior to starting chemotherapy and finishing 3 weeks after their last anthracycline dose. The primary outcome is the presence or absence of cardiac troponin T release at any time during anthracycline treatment, and 1 month after the last dose of anthracycline. Secondary outcomes will focus on cardiac function measured using echocardiogram assessment, adherence to enalapril and side effects. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: A favourable opinion was given following research ethics committee review by West Midlands-Edgbaston REC, Ref: 17/WM/0248.

Foliar spraying with clear water was used as the control treatment. The effects of different iron treatments on berry quality and flavonoid accumulation in grape peels were explored. All five iron treatments affected the sugar, acid, and peel flavonoid contents of grape berries, but the contents varied greatly among the different iron treatments. Foliar spraying with iron increased berry sugar content and reduced acid content. In addition, foliar spraying with ferrous sulfate, EDTA-Fe, ferric gluconate, and ferric sugar alcohol reduced the total anthocyanin, flavanol, and flavonol contents in the peel. The unique flavonoid monomer content of the peel was significantly higher under ferric citrate treatment than under the control and other iron treatments. Moreover, the results showed that foliar spraying with ferric citrate balanced the berry sugar-acid ratio and also increased the anthocyanin, flavanol, and flavonol contents of the grape peel, thereby improving the overall nutritional status of the berries and the final wine quality.

Management of HoFH at an early stage is recommended but conventional lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs) dependent on the LDL-receptor for clearance of LDL particles, are usually not sufficient. However, agents acting independently of the LDL-receptor, such as inhibitors of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) or angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), administered in combination, on top of standard-of-care LLT constitute a promising therapy for HoFH. Case summary: The present case describes a long-term (>10 years) follow-up of a 52-year-old woman with severe HoFH, who was treated with conventional lipid-lowering medications (i.e. statins and ezetimibe) for several years before experiencing the risks and benefits that were encountered with the use of LDL-receptor-independent agents (MTP and ANGPTL3 inhibitors). This combination therapy demonstrated a good long-term safety and efficacy profile, while continuous monitoring of hepatic enzymes (sometimes requiring dose adjustments) and fat accumulation is recommended when using lomitapide. Discussion: Treating this HoFH patient with an LLT involving the combination of MTP and ANGPTL3 LDL-receptor-independent inhibitors (lomitapide and evinacumab, respectively) showed remarkable improvement in LDL-C levels, disappearance of xanthomatosis and regression in atherosclerotic plaques. In addition to safety and efficacy, one should question the affordability and access hurdle that emerging combination of expensive therapies might constitute in the future for the payers.

Although dual anticancer and antimicrobial therapies are a growing therapeutic fashion, they still fall short when it comes to specific delivery and local action in in vivo systems. Nanoparticles are seen as potential therapeutic vectors, be it by means of their intrinsic antibacterial properties and effective delivery capacity, or by means of their repeatedly reported modulation and maneuverability. Herein we report on the production of a biocompatible, antimicrobial magneto-fluorescent nanosystem (NANO3) for the delivery of a dual doxorubicin-ofloxacin formulation against cancer-related bacterial infections. The drug delivery capacity, rendered by its mesoporous silica matrix, is confirmed by the high loading capacity and stimuli-driven release of both drugs, with preference for tumor-like acidic media. The pH-dependent emission of its surface fluorescent SiQDs, provides an insight into NANO3 surface behavior and pore availability, with the SiQDs working as pore gates. Hyperthermia induces heat generation to febrile temperatures, doubling drug release. NANO3-loaded systems demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity, specifically after the application of hyperthermia conditions. NANO3 structure and antimicrobial properties confirm their potential use in a future dual anticancer and antimicrobial therapeutical vector, due to their drug loading capacity and their surface availability for further modification with bioactive, targeting species.", "pmid": "36293142"}

The cell division cycle protein 20 homolog (Cdc20) is a positive regulator of cell division, but how its dysregulation may relate to senescence is unclear. Here, we find that Cdc20 mRNA and protein expression are downregulated in stress-induced premature senescent lung fibroblasts in a p53-dependent manner. Either Cdc20 downregulation or inhibition of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is sufficient to induce premature senescence in lung fibroblasts, while APC/C activation inhibits stress-induced premature senescence. Mechanistically, we show both Cdc20 downregulation and APC/C inhibition induce premature senescence through glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta-mediated phosphorylation and downregulation of securin expression. Interestingly, we determined Cdc20 expression is upregulated in human lung adenocarcinoma. We find that downregulation of Cdc20 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells is sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation and growth in soft agar and to promote apoptosis, but not senescence, in a manner dependent on downregulation of securin following GSK-3beta-mediated securin phosphorylation. Similarly, we demonstrate securin expression is downregulated and cell viability is inhibited in NSCLC cells following inhibition of APC/C. Furthermore, we show chemotherapeutic drugs downregulate both Cdc20 and securin protein expression in NSCLC cells. Either Cdc20 downregulation by siRNA or APC/C inhibition sensitize, while securin overexpression inhibits, chemotherapeutic drug-induced NSCLC cell death. Together, our findings provide evidence that Cdc20/APC/C/securin-dependent signaling is a key regulator of cell survival, and its disruption promotes premature senescence in normal lung cells and induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells that have bypassed the senescence barrier.", "pmid": "35988650"}

Biomarkers that accurately predict effectiveness and safety would enable targeted treatment selection, improved patient outcomes and more cost-effective healthcare. OBJECTIVES: To perform a scoping review to identify and catalogue candidate biomarkers of systemic treatment response in psoriasis for the translational research community. METHODS: A systematic search of CENTRAL, Embase, LILACS and MEDLINE was performed for relevant articles published between 1990 and December 2021. Eligibility criteria were studies involving patients with psoriasis (any age, n >= 50) reporting biomarkers associated with systemic treatment response. The main outcomes were any measure of systemic treatment efficacy or safety. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second; studies meeting minimal quality criteria (use of methods to control for confounding) were formally assessed for bias. Candidate biomarkers were identified by an expert multistakeholder group using a majority voting consensus exercise and mapped to relevant cellular and molecular pathways. RESULTS: Of 71 included studies (67 studying effectiveness outcomes and eight safety outcomes; four studied both), most reported genomic or proteomic biomarkers associated with response to biologics (48 studies). Methodological or reporting limitations frequently compromised the interpretation of findings, including inadequate control for key covariates, lack of adjustment for multiple testing, and selective outcome reporting. We identified candidate biomarkers of efficacy to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors [variation in CARD14, CDKAL1, IL1B, IL12B and IL17RA loci, and lipopolysaccharide-induced phosphorylation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in type 2 dendritic cells] and ustekinumab (HLA-C*06:02 and variation in an IL1B locus). None were supported by sufficient evidence for clinical use without further validation studies. Candidate biomarkers were found to be involved in the immune cellular crosstalk implicated in psoriasis pathogenesis, most notably antigen presentation, T helper (Th)17 cell differentiation, positive regulation of NF-kappaB, and Th17 cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive catalogue provides a key resource for researchers and reveals a diverse range of biomarker types and outcomes in the included studies. The candidate biomarkers identified require further evaluation in methodologically robust studies to establish potential clinical utility. Future studies should aim to address the common methodological limitations highlighted in this review to expedite discovery and validation of biomarkers for clinical use. What is already known about this topic? Responses to the systemic treatments commonly used to treat psoriasis vary.

Interventions that either prevent DNA damage or enhance DNA repair are thus likely to extend health- and lifespan across species. However, effective genome-protecting compounds are largely lacking. Here, we use Ercc1 Delta/- and Xpg -/- DNA repair-deficient mutants as two bona fide accelerated aging mouse models to test propitious anti-aging pharmaceutical interventions. Ercc1 Delta/- and Xpg -/- mice show shortened lifespan with accelerated aging across numerous organs and tissues. Previously, we demonstrated that a well-established anti-aging intervention, dietary restriction, reduced DNA damage, and dramatically improved healthspan, strongly extended lifespan, and delayed all aging pathology investigated. Here, we further utilize the short lifespan and early onset of signs of neurological degeneration in Ercc1 Delta/- and Xpg -/- mice to test compounds that influence nutrient sensing (metformin, acarbose, resveratrol), inflammation (aspirin, ibuprofen), mitochondrial processes (idebenone, sodium nitrate, dichloroacetate), glucose homeostasis (trehalose, GlcNAc) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism. While some of the compounds have shown anti-aging features in WT animals, most of them failed to significantly alter lifespan or features of neurodegeneration of our mice. The two NAD+ precursors; nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinic acid (NA), did however induce benefits, consistent with the role of NAD+ in facilitating DNA damage repair.

Thus, in this study, the authors examined whether common polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in the pharmacodynamics of anthracyclines (in particular, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate:quinone oxidoreductase 1 gene NQO1 and the carbonyl reductase 3 gene CBR3) had an impact on the risk of anthracycline-related CHF. METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted within a cohort of 1979 patients enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who received treatment with anthracyclines and had available DNA. Thirty patients with CHF (cases) and 115 matched controls were genotyped for polymorphisms in NQO1 (NQO1*2) and CBR3 (the CBR3 valine [V] to methionine [M] substitution at position 244 [V244M]). Enzyme activity assays with recombinant CBR3 isoforms (CBR3 V244 and CBR3 M244) and the anthracycline substrate doxorubicin were used to investigate the functional impact of the CBR3 V244M polymorphism. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses adjusted for sex and primary disease recurrence were used to test for associations between the candidate genetic polymorphisms (NQO1*2 and CBR3 V244M) and the risk of CHF. Analyses indicated no association between the NQO1*2 polymorphism and the risk of anthracycline-related CHF (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; P=.97).

However, their functions have not been sufficiently investigated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: The expression profiles of circRNAs in NPC cells within different metastatic potential were reanalyzed. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and in situ hybridization were used to detect the expression level of circPVT1 in NPC cells and tissue samples. The association of expression level of circPVT1 with clinical properties of NPC patients was evaluated. Then, the effects of circPVT1 expression on NPC metastasis were investigated by in vitro and in vivo functional experiments. RNA immunoprecipitation, pull-down assay and western blotting were performed to confirm the interaction between circPVT1 and beta-TrCP in NPC cells. Co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting were performed to confirm the interaction between beta-TrCP and c-Myc in NPC cells. RESULTS: We find that circPVT1, a circular RNA, is significantly upregulated in NPC cells and tissue specimens. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that circPVT1 promotes the invasion and metastasis of NPC cells. Mechanistically, circPVT1 inhibits proteasomal degradation of c-Myc by binding to beta-TrCP, an E3 ubiquiting ligase. Stablization of c-Myc by circPVT1 alters the cytoskeleton remodeling and cell adhesion in NPC, which ultimately promotes the invasion and metastasis of NPC cells. Furthermore, c-Myc transcriptionally upregulates the expression of SRSF1, an RNA splicing factor, and recruits SRSF1 to enhance the biosynthesis of circPVT1 through coupling transcription with splicing, which forms a positive feedback for circPVT1 production. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed the important role of circPVT1 in the progression of NPC through the beta-TrCP/c-Myc/SRSF1 positive feedback loop, and circPVT1 may serve as a prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target in patients with NPC.", "pmid": "36199071"}

Bromodomain-containing-protein-4 (Brd4) and cyclin-dependent-kinase-9 (CDK9) cooperatively control the rate-limiting step of PRG transactivation, including pro-inflammatory genes. This study investigated whether Brd4 and CDK9 inhibitors suppress inflammation and prevent PTOA development in vitro and in a mouse PTOA model. METHODS: The effects of Brd4 and CDK9 inhibitors (JQ1 and Flavopiridol) on PRG and associated secondary damage were rigorously tested in different settings. Short-term effects of inflammatory stimuli (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF) on human chondrocyte PRG expression were assessed by RT-PCR and microarray after 5-h. We quantified glycosaminoglycan release from IL-1beta-treated bovine cartilage explants after 3-6 days, and osteoarthritic changes in mice after ACL-rupture using RT-PCR (2-24hrs), in vivo imaging of MMP activity (24hrs), AFM-nanoindentation (3-7days), and histology (3days-4wks). RESULTS: Flavopiridol and JQ1 inhibitors act synergistically, and a combination of both almost completely prevented the activation of most IL-1beta-induced PRGs in vitro by microarray analysis, and prevented IL-1beta-induced glycosaminoglycan release from cartilage explants. Mice given the drug combination showed reduced IL-1beta and IL-6 expression, less in vivo MMP activity, and lower synovitis (1.5 vs 4.9) and OARSI scores (2.8 vs 6.0) than untreated mice with ACL-rupture. CONCLUSIONS: JQ1 and Flavopiridol work synergistically to reduce injury response after joint trauma, suggesting that targeting Brd4 and/or CDK9 could be a viable strategy for PTOA prevention and treatment of early OA.", "pmid": "33164842"}

BACKGROUND: Newer multiagent NAC regimens have resulted in improved clinical and pathological responses in PDAC; however, the effects of these responses on survival outcomes remain unknown. METHODS: Clinicopathological and survival data of PDAC patients treated at 7 academic medical centers were analyzed. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival (L-RFS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) associated with biochemical (CA 19-9 decrease >=50% vs <50%) and pathological response (complete, pCR; partial, pPR or limited, pLR) following NAC. RESULTS: Of 274 included patients, 46.4% were borderline resectable, 25.5% locally advanced, and 83.2% had pancreatic head/neck tumors. Vein resection was performed in 34.7% and 30-day mortality was 2.2%. R0 and pCR rates were 82.5% and 6%, respectively. Median, 3-year, and 5-year OS were 32 months, 46.3%, and 30.3%, respectively. OS, L-RFS, and MFS were superior in patients with marked biochemical response (CA 19-9 decrease >=50% vs <50%; OS: 42.3 vs 24.3 months, P < 0.001; L-RFS-27.3 vs 14.1 months, P = 0.042; MFS-29.3 vs 13 months, P = 0.047) and pathological response [pCR vs pPR vs pLR: OS- not reached (NR) vs 40.3 vs 26.1 months, P < 0.001; L-RFS-NR vs 24.5 vs 21.4 months, P = 0.044; MFS-NR vs 23.7 vs 20.2 months, P = 0.017]. There was no difference in L-RFS, MFS, or OS between patients who received FLX or GNP. CONCLUSION: This large, multicenter study shows that improved biochemical, pathological, and clinical responses associated with NAC FLX or GNP result in improved OS, L-RFS, and MFS in PDAC.

Three patients with AIHA and eight patients with ITP between 2008 and 2022 were enrolled in the Rheumatology Outpatient Clinic of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung. Those patients were refractory or intolerant to conventional therapy and were treated with danazol. All the patients received an initial dose of danazol (200-400 mg). The observation period was 6 months. Three patients (100%) with AIHA and six (75%) with ITP achieved treatment response after 6 months of danazol therapy. The dose of glucocorticoid for responders could be reduced to <=5 mg/day of prednisolone, and the immunosuppressants, except hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine for systemic lupus erythematosus, could be discontinued. Adverse events were acne in two (18.2%) patients and transient dose-related liver function impairment in one (9.1%) patient in the current series. Danazol therapy appears to be a favorable alternative for refractory AIHA and ITP by altering the erythrocyte membrane to resist osmotic lysis and protecting platelets against complement-mediated lysis.

A 43-year-old male visited our hospital with complaints of progressing gait disturbance since a generalized tonic clonic seizure. There were no past neurological symptoms or familial disorders. Neurological examination revealed bradykinesia, masked face, stooped posture, parkinsonian gait, and postural instability. The bilateral uptake by dopamine transporters was nearly abolished, as determined by N-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)- 2beta-carbon ethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane positron emission tomography (18F-FP-CIT PET).

The treatments for AD pose a significant challenge, because the mechanisms of disease are not being fully understood. Malfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to the pathophysiology of AD, especially at the early stages of the disease. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterized, while few molecules can directly target and improve BBB function in the context of AD. Here, we showed dysfunctional BBB in AD patients reflected by perivascular accumulation of blood-derived fibrinogen in the hippocampus and cortex, accompanied by decreased tight junction proteins Claudin-5 and glucose transporter Glut-1 in the brain endothelial cells (BECs). In the APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD, BBB dysfunction started at 4 months of age and became severe at 9 months of age. In the cerebral microvessels of APP/PS1 mice and Abeta-treated BECs, we found suppressed Wnt/beta-catenin signaling triggered by an increase of GSK3beta activation, but not an inhibition of the AKT pathway or switching to the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway. Furthermore, using our newly developed optogenetic tool for controlled regulation of LRP6 (upstream regulator of the Wnt signaling) to activate Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, BBB malfunction was restored by preventing Abeta-induced BEC impairments and promoting the barrier repair. In conclusion, targeting LRP6 in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the brain endothelium can alleviate BBB malfunction induced by Abeta, which may be a potential treatment strategy for AD.", "pmid": "35788280"}

METHODS: Histological analysis, immunohistochemistry analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis, RT-qPCR, and 16S rRNA analysis were utilized to explore the effect mechanism of the five excipients including hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) F4M, Eudragit (EU) S100, chitosan (CT), pectin (PT), and rheum officinale polysaccharide (DHP) on berberine (BBR) to cure UC. RESULTS: The combined BBR with PT and DHP group exhibited better therapeutic efficacy of UC with significantly increased colon length, and decreased hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) scores than other groups. Furthermore, the expression of tight junction ZO-1 and occludin in colon tissue were upregulated, and claudin-2 was downregulated. Ultimately, the serum content of tumor necrosis (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 was decreased. Moreover, the combined BBR with PT significantly promoted the restoration of gut microbiota.

In the present study, the mechanism underlying the activation of cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61 (Cyr61) by ATF3 in hyperproliferative and fibrotic human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs), induced by angiotensin II (Ang II), was evaluated. The mRNA and protein expression levels of ATF3 and Cyr61 were assessed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to assess cell viability. Cell migration was assessed using the wound healing assay and western blotting, whereas the extent of cell fibrosis was evaluated using immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. The binding site of ATF3 to the Cyr61 promoter was predicted using the JASPAR database, and verified using luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The results demonstrated that the mRNA and protein expression levels of ATF3 were significantly upregulated in Ang II-induced HCFs. Overexpression of ATF3 significantly inhibited the Ang II-induced viability, migration and fibrosis of HCFs, whereas ATF3 knockdown mediated significant opposing effects. Mechanistically, ATF3 was demonstrated to transcriptionally activate Cyr61. Cyr61 silencing was subsequently revealed to reverse the effects of ATF3 overexpression on HCFs potentially via regulation of the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway. The results of the present study suggested that ATF3 could suppress HCF viability and fibrosis via the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway by activating the transcription of Cyr61.", "pmid": "36102309"}

Rapid proliferation and diffuse migration are the main obstacles to successful glioma treatment. Xanthatin, a sesquiterpene lactone purified from Xanthium strumarium L., possesses a significant antitumor role in several malignant tumors. In this study, we report that xanthatin suppressed glioma cells proliferation and induced apoptosis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, and was accompanied by autophagy inhibition displaying a significantly reduced LC3 punctate fluorescence and LC3II/I ratio, decreased level of Beclin 1, while increased accumulation of p62. Notably, treating glioma cells with xanthatin resulted in obvious activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, as indicated by increased mTOR and Akt phosphorylation, decreased ULK1 phosphorylation, which is important in modulating autophagy. Furthermore, xanthatin-mediated pro-apoptosis in glioma cells was significantly reversed by autophagy inducers (rapamycin or Torin1), or PI3K-mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. Taken together, these findings indicate that anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects of xanthatin in glioma are most likely by inhibiting autophagy via activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy against glioma.", "pmid": "36572650"}

However, characteristics of CEP55 expression and its clinical/prognostic significance are unclear in human epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Therefore, we investigated the expression and clinicopathological significance of CEP55 in patients with EOC and its role in regulating invasion and metastasis of ovarian cell lines. CEP55 mRNA and protein expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Potential associations of CEP55 expression scores with clinical parameters and patient survival were evaluated. CEP55 function was investigated further using RNA interference, wound healing assay, transwell assay, immunofluorescence analysis, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting. CEP55 was significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer cell lines and lesions compared with normal cells and adjacent noncancerous ovarian tissues. In the 213 EOC samples, CEP55 protein levels were positively correlated with clinical stage (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), intraperitoneal metastasis (P < 0.001), tumor recurrence (P < 0.001), differentiation grade (P < 0.001), residual tumor size (P < 0.001), ascites see tumor cells (P = 0.020), and serum CA153 level (P < 0.001). Moreover, patients with aberrant CEP55 protein expression showed tendencies to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P < 0.001) and cytoreductive surgery (P = 0.020). By contrast, no significant correlation was detected between the protein levels and patient age, histological type, or serum CA125, CA199, CA724, NSE, CEA, and b-HCG levels. Patients with high CEP55 protein expression had shorter overall survival and disease-free survival compared with those with low CEP55 expression. Multivariate analysis implicated CEP55 as an independent prognostic indicator for EOC patients.

Here we report intricate crosstalk among the 3 pathways, centered around the SEL1L-HRD1 protein complex of ERAD, in the regulation of organellar organization in beta cells. SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD deficiency in beta cells triggers activation of autophagy, at least in part, via IRE1alpha (an endogenous ERAD substrate). In the absence of functional SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, proinsulin is retained in the ER as high molecular weight conformers, which are subsequently cleared via ER-phagy. A combined loss of both SEL1L and autophagy in beta cells leads to diabetes in mice shortly after weaning, with premature death by approximately 11 weeks of age, associated with marked ER retention of proinsulin and beta cell loss. Using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy powered by deep-learning automated image segmentation and 3D reconstruction, our data demonstrate a profound organellar restructuring with a massive expansion of ER volume and network in beta cells lacking both SEL1L and autophagy.

Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic targets and effective treatment strategies is essential. Nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) is widely used as the standard chemotherapeutic agent and is frequently administered together with other chemotherapeutic agents in clinical studies. Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound, could potentially be combined with chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment; however, there are no reports of studies where ACNU and curcumin were combined for GBM treatment, and the mechanisms underlying their activity remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of combined treatment with curcumin and ACNU on GBM cells and found that it significantly enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion. In addition, co-treatment with curcumin increased ACNU-induced apoptosis through enhancing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol. Further, curcumin and ACNU acted synergistically in their antitumor effects by targeting N-cadherin/MMP2/9, PI3K/AKT, and NF-kappaB/COX-2 signaling.

The comparison between the gene expression, protein content, and enzymatic activities of cytosolic alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases of the wild-type strain and the Deltasod1 mutant lacking superoxide dismutase 1, which is hypersensitive to alcohols and aldehydes, shows that the activity of these enzymes is significantly higher in the Deltasod1 mutant, but this is not a mere consequence of differences in the enzymatic protein content nor in the expression levels of genes. The analysis of the NAD(H) and NADP(H) content showed that the higher activity of alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases in the Deltasod1 mutant could be a result of the increased availability of pyridine nucleotide cofactors. The higher level of NAD+ in the Deltasod1 mutant is not related to the higher level of tryptophan; in turn, a higher generation of NADPH is associated with the upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway. It is concluded that the increased sensitivity of the Deltasod1 mutant to alcohols and aldehydes is not only a result of the disorder of redox homeostasis caused by the induction of oxidative stress but also a consequence of the unbalance between pyridine nucleotide cofactors.", "pmid": "36614102"}

We previously found that protein disulfide isomerase family 6 (PDIA6) is upregulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). This study aimed to elucidate the clinical relevance, biological functions, and molecular mechanisms of PDIA6 in NSCLC. METHODS: The expression of PDIA6 in NSCLC was assessed using the TCGA database, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Correlations of PDIA6 expression with clinicopathological and survival features were evaluated. The functions of PDIA6 in regulating NSCLC cell growth, apoptosis, and autophagy were investigated using gain-and loss-of-function strategies in vitro or in vivo. The underlying molecular mechanisms of PDIA6 function were examined by human phospho-kinase array and co-immunoprecipitation. FINDINGS: PDIA6 expression was upregulated in NSCLC compared with adjacent normal tissues, and the higher PDIA6 expression was correlated with poor prognosis. PDIA6 knockdown decreased NSCLC cell proliferation and increased cisplatin-induced intrinsic apoptosis, while PDIA6 overexpression had the opposite effects. In addition, PDIA6 regulated cisplatin-induced autophagy, and this contributed to PDIA6-mediated apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, PDIA6 reduced the phosphorylation levels of JNK and c-Jun. Moreover, PDIA6 interacted with MAP4K1 and inhibited its phosphorylation, ultimately inhibiting the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway.

Transwell, CCK-8, and tube formation assays were performed to examine cell migration, proliferation, and tube formation. AQP8, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-alpha, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression levels were investigated. Relative to the control group, the placentas in the GDM group showed morphological changes, the number of microvessels in the placental villi arterioles was significantly higher, and the area of microvessels in the arterioles of placental villi was significantly lower. The expression levels of VCAM-1, TNF-alpha, VEGF-A, and AQP8 in the GDM placentas and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated by high glucose were significantly higher than those in the control group, and AQP8 was located in placental endothelial cells. Overexpression of glucose and AQP8 inhibited tube formation, migration, and proliferation in HUVECs. High glucose levels can induce dysfunction in vascular endothelial cells and lead to pathological changes in the placental vascular structure in GDM. AQP8 overexpression in placental GDM can inhibit endothelial cell behavior, cause endothelial cell dysfunction, and further participate in the occurrence and development of GDM placental vascular lesions.", "pmid": "36448064"}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened Greek ADPKD patients with the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) assay and direct sequencing. RESULTS: We identified a patient homozygous for a nucleotide change c.1445T > G, resulting in a novel homozygous substitution of the non-polar hydrophobic phenylalanine to the polar hydrophilic cysteine in exon 6 at codon 482 (p.F482C) of the PKD2 gene and a de-novo PKD1 splice-site variant IVS21-2delAG. We did not find this PKD2 variant in a screen of 280 chromosomes of healthy subjects, supporting its pathogenicity. The proband's parents did not have the PKD1 mutation. Real-time PCR of the PKD2 transcript from a skin biopsy revealed 20-fold higher expression in the patient than in a healthy subject and was higher in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than in those of her heterozygote daughter and a healthy subject. The greater gene expression was also supported by Western blotting. Inner medullar collecting duct (IMCD) cells transfected with the mutant PKD2 mouse gene presented a perinuclear and diffuse cytoplasmic localization compared with the wild type ER localization. Patch-clamping of PBMCs from the p.F482C homozygous and heterozygous subjects revealed lower polycystin-2 channel function than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time a patient with ADPKD who is heterozygous for a de novo PKD1 variant and homozygous for a novel PKD2 mutation.", "pmid": "18257781"}

Although their function(s) is still obscure, Nbs trap NO and inactivate peroxynitrite. Here, the kinetics of peroxynitrite scavenging by ferric Danio rerio Nb (Dr-Nb(III)) in the absence and presence of CO2 is reported. The Dr-Nb(III)-catalyzed scavenging of peroxynitrite is facilitated by a low pH, indicating that the heme protein interacts preferentially with peroxynitrous acid, leading to the formation of nitrate (~91%) and nitrite (~9%). The physiological levels of CO2 dramatically facilitate the spontaneous decay of peroxynitrite, overwhelming the scavenging activity of Dr-Nb(III). The effect of Dr-Nb(III) on the peroxynitrite-induced nitration of L-tyrosine was also investigated. Dr-Nb(III) inhibits the peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of free L-tyrosine, while, in the presence of CO2, Dr-Nb(III) does not impair nitro-L-tyrosine formation. The comparative analysis of the present results with data reported in the literature indicates that, to act as efficient peroxynitrite scavengers in vivo, i.e., in the presence of physiological levels of CO2, the ferric heme protein concentration must be higher than 10-4 M. Thus, only the circulating ferric hemoglobin levels appear to be high enough to efficiently compete with CO2/HCO3- in peroxynitrite inactivation. The present results are of the utmost importance for tissues, like the eye retina in fish, where blood circulation is critical for adaptation to diving conditions.", "pmid": "36290653"}

However, according to the literature, the effect of rs4646994 and rs2285666 polymorphisms on susceptibility and progression to severe clinical outcomes is still controversial. Our aim was to investigate the effect of polymorphisms such as rs4646994 and rs2285666 on susceptibility to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using databases such as ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar to retrieve studies on the effect of two polymorphisms (rs4646994 and rs2285666) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene on COVID-19. Finally, the effect of each polymorphism on SARS-CoV-2 infection was measured based on the odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Analysis of the rs4646994 polymorphism showed that the frequency of the D allele in patients infected with COVID-19 was higher than that the I allele. Moreover, the authors found that the DD genotype increased the risk of severe disease by 1.7-fold in Asian population, whereas, this was not the case in the Western population. However, the rs4646994 II genotype plays a protective role against COVID-19 in Western countries. In the case of the rs2285666 polymorphism based on patient ethnicity, the C allele had the highest frequency. Interestingly, in people harboring the GG and TT genotypes, the risk of progression to severe disease significantly increased, while people with genotypes such as GA, AA and CC seem to be more resistant to severe Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: Based on geographical region, the rs4646994 DD genotype may be considered as a predictive biomarker to identify the susceptibility of human to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. We also concluded that individuals with GG and TT genotypes are significantly more susceptible to severe outcomes of disease, while conversely, individuals with GA, AA, and CC genotypes are less susceptible to severe COVID-19.", "pmid": "36116608"}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the gut microbiota and its derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on obesity-induced precocious puberty rats and their regulatory mechanisms. We constructed obesity-induced precocious puberty rats using a high-fat diet (HFD) had notable similarity to precocious puberty caused by obesity due to overeating in children. We then added acetate, propionate, butyrate or their mixture to the HFD, and investigated the effect of intestinal microbiota and its derived SCFAs on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA) in rats with obesity-induced precocious puberty. We found that obesity-induced precocious puberty rats had an early first estrous cycle, increased hypothalamic mRNA expression of Kiss1, GPR54 and GnRH, and early gonadal maturation. Meanwhile, the intestinal microbiota imbalance and the main SCFAs production decreased in the colon. The addition of acetate, propionate, butyrate or their mixture to the HFD could significantly reverse the precocious puberty of rats, reduce GnRH release from the hypothalamus and delay the development of the gonadal axis through the Kiss1-GPR54-PKC-ERK1/2 pathway.

Proanthocyanidins (PCs) have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. Previously, we discovered that PCs alleviated psoriasis-like mice symptoms, likely via mitigating inflammation and OS damage. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the protective mechanism underlying PCs against the damage of TNF-alpha-induced psoriasis-like cell models. METHODS: Psoriasis-like cell models were established with 7.5 ng/mL TNF-alpha and then subjected to different-concentrations PCs treatment. Finally, inflammatory and oxidative parameters were determined. Besides, LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) and ZnPP (HO-1 inhibitor) were employed to investigate the roles of PI3K/AKT and HO-1 in PCs against psoriasis-like cell models. RESULTS: After TNF-alpha treatment, cells organized tightly and proliferated greatly (P<0.01); HO-1 expression dropped obviously, along with the increased OS/inflammatory indicators and the decreased antioxidants (P<0.05); consequently, psoriasis-like cell models were well established. In the presence of PCs, nevertheless, the proliferation rate and number of psoriasis-like cells evidently decreased (P<0.01), accompanied with enhanced HO-1 and antioxidants, and lowered OS/inflammatory indicators as well as phosphorylated JAK2/STAT3/PI3/AKT (P<0.01). Similar changes appeared after LY294002 pretreatment, regardless of PCs or not. But after ZnPP pretreatment with or without PCs, the opposite occurred. CONCLUSION: The study reveals that PCs can suppress psoriasis-like cell proliferation and reduce inflammatory/OS damage through PI3K/AKT inhibition and HO-1 activation, thus promising a candidate for PCs in treating psoriasis.", "pmid": "36178125"}

The control, PPA intoxicated, and treated groups were subjected to behavioral tests (Y-Maze and open field), antioxidant analysis, gene expression analysis, and histological examination at different time intervals of the study. The results revealed that Co-Q10 and L Co-Q10 significantly elevated antioxidative stress biomarkers, comprising superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). In addition, they significantly ameliorated the oxidative stress biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA). Meanwhile, they significantly downregulated GFAP and CACNA1C mRNA gene expressions, Co-Q10 and LCo-Q10 showed improvement in almost brain regions post PPA histopathological alterations, even better results were manifested via LCo-Q10 groups.

{"abstract_id": "1097", "title": "Synergistic effect of glutathione and IgG4 in immune evasion and the implication for cancer immunotherapy.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We recently reported a novel IgG4-centered immune evasion mechanism in cancer, and this was achieved mostly through the Fc-Fc reaction of increased IgG4 to cancer-bound IgG in cancer microenvironment. The mechanism was suggested to be related to cancer hyperprogressive disease (HPD) which is a side-effect often associated to IgG4 subtype PD-1 antibody immunotherapy. HPD was reported to occur in cancers with certain mutated genes including KRAS and such mutations are often associated to glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Therefore, we hypothesize that IgG4 and GSH may play a synergistic role in local immunosuppression of cancer. METHODS: Quantitatively analyzed the distribution and abundance of GSH and IgG4 in human cancer samples with ELISA and immunohistochemistry. The interactions between GSH and IgG4 were examined with Electrophoresis and Western Blot. The synergistic effects of the two on classic immune responses were investigated in vitro. The combined effects were also tested in a lung cancer model and a skin graft model in mice. RESULTS: We detected significant increases of both GSH and IgG4 in the microenvironment of lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and colon cancer tissues. GSH disrupted the disulfide bond of IgG4 heavy chain and enhanced IgG4's ability of Fc-Fc reaction to immobilized IgG subtypes. Combined administration of IgG4 and GSH augmented the inhibitory effect of IgG4 on the classic ADCC, ADCP, and CDC reactions. Local administration of IgG4/GSH achieved the most obvious effect of accelerating cancer growth in the mouse lung cancer model. The same combination prolonged the survival of skin grafts between two different strains of mouse. In both models, immune cells and several cytokines were found to shift to the state of immune tolerance. CONCLUSION: Combined application of GSH and IgG4 can promote tumor growth and protect skin graft. The mechanism may be achieved through the effect of the Fc-Fc reaction between IgG4 and other tissue-bound IgG subtypes resulting in local immunosuppression. This reaction was facilitated by increased GSH to dissociate the two heavy chains of IgG4 Fc fragment at its disulfide bonds. Our findings unveiled the interaction between the redox system and the immune systems in cancer microenvironment. It offers a sensible explanation for HPD and provides new possibilities for manipulating this mechanism for cancer immunotherapy.", "pmid": "36681047"}

It may also represent an interesting alternative to gallium-68 (68Ga) as a radionuclide precursor for labelling radiopharmaceuticals used to investigate neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer. This emerging interest is also related to the nuclear properties of 64CuCl2 that make it an ideal theragnostic nuclide.

Enzyme crystallized with the good substrates NAD+ and 4-methylbenzyl alcohol was found to be an abortive complex of NADH with 4-methylbenzyl alcohol rotated to a \"non-productive\" mode as compared to the structures that resemble reactive Michaelis complexes with NAD+ and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol or 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl alcohol. The NADH is formed by reduction of the NAD+ with the alcohol during the crystallization. The same structure was also formed by directly crystallizing the enzyme with NADH and 4-methylbenzyl alcohol. Crystals prepared with NAD+ and 4-bromobenzyl alcohol also form the abortive complex with NADH. Surprisingly, crystals prepared with NAD+ and the strong inhibitor 1H,1H-heptafluorobutanol also had NADH, and the alcohol was bound in two different conformations that illustrate binding flexibility. Oxidation of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol during the crystallization apparently led to reduction of the NAD+.

METHODS: The function and mechanisms of APPBP2 were investigated in the NSCLC cell lines A549 and H1299. The ectopic expression of APPBP2, PPM1D and SPOP in NSCLS were examined in samples collected from ten pairs of human lung adenocarcinoma cancer tissues and adjacent normal lung tissues. shRNA vector was used for APPBP2 knockdown. Quantitative PCR and western blot assays quantified the mRNA and protein level of APPBP2, PPM1D, and SPOP. Cell proliferation was measured with BrdU, MTT, colony formation assays, and xenograft tumour growth experiments. Cell migration and invasion were analysed with transwell and wound healing assays. Co-Immunoprecipitation assay detected protein-protein interactions. FINDINGS: APPBP2 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues. Silencing APPBP2 in A549 and H1299 cells resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, enhancement of apoptosis, and a significant decrease in the expression of PPM1D and SPOP. Overexpression of PPM1D and SPOP attenuated the APPBP2-knockdown inhibition of NSCLC cells. Co-IP assay showed that PPM1D interacted with APPBP2.

Tryptone-free MRS was found to enhance the tolerance of L. rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 to heat stress and oxidative stress during the whole growth period, and this result was universal for all L. rhamnosus species analyzed. The strongest strengthening effect occurred when the OD600 value reached 2.0, at which the survival rates under heat stress and oxidative stress increased 130-fold and 40-fold, respectively. After supplementing phenylalanine, isoleucine, glutamate, valine, histidine, or tryptophan into the tryptone-free MRS, the tolerance of L. rhamnosus to heat stress and oxidative stress exhibited a sharp drop.

Moreover, SFN enhanced the intestinal tight junction protein ZO-1, reduced serum LPS, and inhibited LPS/TLR4 and ERS pathways to reduce intestinal inflammation. As a result, SFN protected the intestinal integrity and declined the gut-derived LPS translocations to the liver in HFHFr diet-induced mice. SFN decreased the liver LPS levels and inhibited the LPS/TLR4 pathway activations, thus inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokines.

The ketone body, D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (D-BHB), is metabolized to acetyl-CoA in brain mitochondria and used as an energy fuel alternative to glucose. We have previously reported that D-BHB sustains ATP production and stimulates the autophagic flux under glucose deprivation in neurons; however, the effects of D-BHB on mitochondrial turnover under physiological conditions are still unknown. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are NAD+-activated protein deacetylases involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy through the activation of transcription factors FOXO1, FOXO3a, TFEB and PGC1alpha coactivator. Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of D-BHB on mitochondrial turnover in cultured neurons and the mechanisms involved. Results show that D-BHB increased mitochondrial membrane potential and regulated the NAD+/NADH ratio. D-BHB enhanced FOXO1, FOXO3a and PGC1alpha nuclear levels in an SIRT2-dependent manner and stimulated autophagy, mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. These effects increased neuronal resistance to energy stress. D-BHB also stimulated the autophagic-lysosomal pathway through AMPK activation and TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis.

Psychotropic drugs are one of the most commonly used drugs in the world. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of environmentally-relevant concentrations of the antipsychotic drugs, sulpiride and clozapine, on dopaminergic (DAergic) and serotonergic (5-HTergic) neurotransmitter systems in the brain of zebrafish. Adult zebrafish (AB strain) were exposed to the environmentally-relevant concentrations of sulpiride, clozapine, or a mixture of sulpiride and clozapine. The effects of the drugs on the mRNA and protein levels of major functional molecules in DAergic and 5-HTergic systems were then analyzed in the telencephalon and diencephalon. Both drugs induced abnormal mRNA and protein levels of important functional molecules of the DA and 5-HT signaling pathways in both telencephalon and diencephalon, as shown by the abnormal transcriptional levels of TH, DAT, DR D1, DR D2, MAO, TPH, serotonin transporter (SERT), 5-HTR 1AA, 5-HTR 1B, 5-THR 2AA, and 5-HTR 2B, and the abnormal translational levels of DAT, DR D2, SERT, 5-HTR 1A, 5-HTR 1B, and 5-HTR 2B. In addition, we observed a specificity in the adverse effects of these antipsychotic drugs, in terms of doses and brain parts. Compared to their effects alone, the drug mixture had a weaker effect on the DA and 5-HT systems, suggesting an antagonistic interaction between sulpiride and clozapine.

Characterizing the host cytokine response to RSV infection, the regulation of host cytokines and the impact of neutralizing an RSV-inducible cytokine during infection were undertaken in this study. METHODS: A549, primary human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells and wild-type, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b (Trif) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (Mavs) knockout (KO) mice were infected with RSV and cytokine responses were investigated by ELISA, multiplex analysis and qPCR. Neutralizing anti-leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) IgG or control IgG was administered to a group of wild-type animals prior to RSV infection. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: RSV-infected A549 and SAE cells release a network of cytokines, including newly identified RSV-inducible cytokines LIF, migration inhibitory factor (MIF), stem cell factor (SCF), CCL27, CXCL12 and stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF-b). These RSV-inducible cytokines were also observed in the airways of mice during an infection.

Multiple medications have been reported to cause DRESS with the presentation varying from drug to drug. Some cases are mild and can be managed by stopping the causative agent along with supportive measures; however, other cases can lead to multi-organ failure requiring systemic corticosteroids and organ transplant. Acute liver failure is a rare manifestation of DRESS. We report a patient who had recently completed a course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and presented with low-grade fever, diffuse skin rash, eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes, acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia. DRESS was subsequently diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and relatively negative workup for an alternate diagnosis. The patient eventually showed improvement with steroid therapy without the need for a liver transplant. Due to its pharmacogenetic susceptibility, it is essential to recommend avoiding the causative medication for the patient's family members.", "pmid": "36457619"}
{"abstract_id": "1107", "title": "Histone methylation-mediated microRNA-32-5p down-regulation in sensory neurons regulates pain behaviors via targeting Cav3.2 channels.", "abstract": "microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene regulation has been studied as a therapeutic approach, but its functional regulatory mechanism in neuropathic pain is not well understood. Here, we identify that miRNA-32-5p (miR-32-5p) is a functional RNA in regulating trigeminal-mediated neuropathic pain. High-throughput sequencing and qPCR analysis showed that miR-32-5p was the most down-regulated miRNA in the injured trigeminal ganglion (TG) of rats. Intra-TG injection of miR-32-5p agomir or overexpression of miR-32-5p by lentiviral delivery in neurons of the injured TG attenuated established trigeminal neuropathic pain. miR-32-5p overexpression did not affect acute physiological pain, while miR-32-5p down-regulation in intact rats was sufficient to cause pain-related behaviors. Nerve injury increased the methylated histone occupancy of binding sites for the transcription factor glucocorticoid receptor in the miR-32-5p promoter region. Inhibition of the enzymes that catalyze H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 restored the expression of miR-32-5p and markedly attenuated pain behaviors. Further, miR-32-5p-targeted Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels and decreased miR-32-5p associated with neuropathic pain caused an increase in Cav3.2 protein expression and T-type channel currents. Conversely, miR-32-5p overexpression in injured TG suppressed the increased expression of Cav3.2 and reversed mechanical allodynia. Together, we conclude that histone methylation-mediated miR-32-5p down-regulation in TG neurons regulates trigeminal neuropathic pain by targeting Cav3.2 channels.", "pmid": "35353623"}

Neurotoxicity caused by BCFA-like VPA may be mediated by oxidative stress, according to research involving the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In the present study, we explored the possible protective effect of different antioxidants such as melatonin, quercetin, and piperine on VPA exposure by using a supernatant preparation of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum regions of the rat brain. The present study revealed that melatonin, quercetin, and piperine significantly prevented VPA-induced oxidative stress in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum regions. VPA was also observed to lower the level of reduced glutathione, and this effect was significantly mitigated by these antioxidants. Melatonin, quercetin, and piperine also ameliorated and altered the activities of AChE, Na+, K+ATPase, and MAO in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Results of this study also suggest that prior treatment of antioxidants like melatonin, quercetin, and piperine helps in combating the oxidative stress induced by VPA in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum region of the rat brain. Thus, sufficient dietary intake of these antioxidants by individuals at high risk of VPA exposure could prove beneficial in combating the adverse effect of VPA.", "pmid": "36340064"}

However, there are inadequate concrete guidelines for the management of diabetes in these patients, particularly in the early stage. Bile aids (BAs) have been found to exert hormone-like functions in the control of lipid and glucose metabolism. We studied the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on glucose levels in rats with cirrhosis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). METHODS: SD rats were divided into three groups: sham operation (Group A); BDL (Group B), and UDCA plus BDL (Group C). After 4 weeks, oral glucose tolerance tests were performed. Serum biochemical parameters and the levels of glucose, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) were measured. Histopathology of the liver and islet was observed. The gene expression of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroylase (CYP7A1), microsomal oxysterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) in the liver, and Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor-5 (TGR5) in the intestine was determined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Compared with Group A, fasting glucose and 1-h and 2-h postprandial glucose levels increased slightly (all P > 0.05), 2-h postprandial insulin levels increased significantly (P < 0.05), 15 min postprandial GLP-1 levels decreased (P < 0.05) in Group B. Compared with Group B, fasting glucose and 1-h postprandial glucose levels decreased (all P < 0.05), 2-h postprandial insulin levels decreased (P < 0.01), and 15 min postprandial GLP-1 levels increased (P < 0.05) in Group C. After UDCA intervention, liver fibrosis induced by BDL was alleviated, and the islet areas were increased (P < 0.05). Compared with Group A, the mRNA expression of CYP7A1 and CYP7B1 in the liver increased, and the mRNA expression of TGR5 in the intestine decreased in Group B (all P < 0.05). Compared with Group B, the mRNA expression of CYP7A1 and CYP7B1 in the liver decreased, and TGR5 in the intestine increased in Group C (P < 0.05).

Early clinical trials using macrophage targeting compounds are currently ongoing. However, the most optimal detection method of M1-like and M2-like macrophage subsets and their clinical relevance in breast cancer is still unclear. We aimed to optimize the assessment of TAM subsets in different breast cancer subtypes, and therefore related TAM subset numbers and ratio to clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcome. METHODS: Tissue microarrays of 347 consecutive primary Luminal-A, Luminal-B, HER2-positive and triple-negative tumours of patients with early-stage breast cancer were serially sectioned and immunohistochemically stained for the pan-macrophage marker CD68 and the M2-like macrophage markers CD163, CSF-1R and CD206. TAM numbers were quantified using a digital image analysis algorithm. M1-like macrophage numbers were calculated by subtracting M2-like TAM numbers from the total TAM number. RESULTS: M2-like markers CD163 and CSF-1R showed a moderate positive association with each other and with CD68 (r >= 0.47), but only weakly with CD206 (r <= 0.06). CD68 + , CD163 + and CSF-1R + macrophages correlated with tumour grade in Luminal-B tumours (P < 0.001). Total or subset TAM numbers did not correlate with disease outcome in any breast cancer subtype.

The large G-protein-coupled receptor family includes cannabinoid receptors CB1, CB2, GPR55, and non-specific ion receptor protein transporters TRPs. First, we found up-regulated CNR1, GPR55, and TRPV1 expression in glioma patient-derived tissue samples and cell lines compared with non-malignant brain samples. CNR1 and GPR55 did not correlate with glioma grade, whereas TRPV1 negatively correlated with grade and positively correlated with longer overall survival. This suggests a tumour-suppressor role of TRPV1. With respect to markers of GBM stem cells, preferred targets of therapy, TRPV1 and GPR55, but not CNR1, strongly correlated with different sets of stemness gene markers: NOTCH, OLIG2, CD9, TRIM28, and TUFM and CD15, SOX2, OCT4, and ID1, respectively. This is in line with the higher expression of TRPV1 and GPR55 genes in GSCs compared with differentiated GBM cells. Second, in a panel of patient-derived GSCs, we found that CBG and CBD exhibited the highest cytotoxicity at a molar ratio of 3:1.

Endoglin gene (ENG) encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein which acts as an accessory receptor for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, and is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity. A 6-base insertion in intron 7 (6bINS) of ENG has been reported to be associated with microvascular disturbance. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the relationship between 6bINS and the vascular complication pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in SSc in a French Caucasian population. METHODS: Two hundred eighty SSc cases containing 29/280 having PAH diagnosed by catheterism were compared with 140 patients with osteoarthritis. Genotyping was performed by polymerase-chain-reaction-based fluorescence and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. RESULTS: The polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We observed a significant lower frequency of 6bINS allele in SSc patients with associated PAH compared with controls [10.3 vs 23.9%, P = 0.01; odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-0.89], and a trend in comparison with SSc patients without PAH (10.3 vs 20.3%, P = 0.05; OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.19-1.08). Genotypes carrying allele 6bINS were also less frequent in SSc patients with PAH than in controls (20.7 vs 42.9%, P = 0.02).

To provide the structural framework for receptor activation by IL-27 and its emerging therapeutic targeting, we report here crystal structures of mouse IL-27 in complex with IL-27Ralpha and of human IL-27 in complex with SRF388, a monoclonal antibody undergoing clinical trials with oncology indications. One face of the helical p28 subunit interacts with EBI3, while the opposite face nestles into the interdomain elbow of IL-27Ralpha to juxtapose IL-27Ralpha to EBI3. This orients IL-27Ralpha for paired signaling with gp130, which only uses its immunoglobulin domain to bind to IL-27. Such a signaling complex is distinct from those mediated by IL-12 and IL-23. The SRF388 binding epitope on IL-27 overlaps with the IL-27Ralpha interaction site explaining its potent antagonistic properties.

However, in applications where small size is key, fusion to an additional molecule can be disadvantageous. Albumin-derived affinity proteins (ADAPTs) are a new type of scaffold proteins based on one of the albumin-binding domains of streptococcal protein G, with engineered binding specificities against numerous targets. Here, we engineered this scaffold further and showed that this domain, as small as 6 kDa, can harbor two distinct binding surfaces and utilize them to interact with two targets simultaneously. These novel ADAPTs were developed to possess affinity toward both serum albumin as well as another clinically relevant target, thus circumventing the need for an albumin-binding fusion partner. To accomplish this, we designed a phage display library and used it to successfully select for single-domain bispecific binders toward a panel of targets: TNFalpha, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), C-reactive protein (CRP), renin, angiogenin, myeloid-derived growth factor (MYDGF), and insulin. Apart from successfully identifying bispecific binders for all targets, we also demonstrated the formation of the ternary complex consisting of the ADAPT together with albumin and each of the five targets, TNFalpha, PSA, angiogenin, MYDGF, and insulin. This simultaneous binding of albumin and other targets presents an opportunity to combine the advantages of small molecules with those of larger ones allowing for lower cost of goods and noninvasive administration routes while still maintaining a sufficient in vivo half-life.", "pmid": "33259222"}

The aim of this present study was to explore the prevention and treatment strategies and elucidate the specific mechanism of diabetes-induced vascular endothelial injury. Melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland to regulate biological rhythm, serves an important role in maintaining human physiological function. Pyroptosis is a type of newly discovered inflammatory cell death. The current study first found by western blotting that melatonin could activate nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under high glucose (HG) condition. Second, it found that pretreatment with Luzindole, a specific inhibitor of melatonin receptor (MT1/MT2), significantly reduced the activation of Nrf2 pathway by melatonin in HUVECs. It also found that pretreatment with melatonin or a specific NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inhibitor (MCC950) pretreatment reduced HG-induced endothelial cell pyroptosis. Finally, it was found that the protective effect of melatonin against reactive oxygen species/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway activation induced by HG in HUVECs was decreased after Nrf2 knockdown. In conclusion, the present study showed that melatonin may serve a protective role in HG-induced vascular endothelial cell pyroptosis by activating the Nrf2 pathway to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition, it was further found that melatonin attenuated HG-induced vascular endothelial cell injury by interacting with its receptors (MT1/MT2) to promote activation of Nrf2 pathway.", "pmid": "36799176"}

The poor survival may be due to a high proportion of tumor metastasis. RON and CXCR4 are the key regulators of cell motility in BC, while the relationship between RON and CXCR4 remains elusive. In the present study, immunohistochemistry analysis of BC and adjacent normal tissues found that higher RON expression was positively correlated with CXCR4 expression. Inhibiting and replenishing RON level were used to regulate CXCR4 expression, observing the effects on migration and invasion of BC cells. Overexpression of RON reversed the inhibited cell migration and invasion following siCXCR4 treatment. Conversely, overexpression of CXCR4 restored the inhibition of cell migration and invasion caused by shRON. The activation of RON-MAPK/RSK/CREB pathway was demonstrated in BC cells under MSP treatment. Dual luciferase and CHIP assay showed that p-CREB targeted CXCR4 by binding to its CRE sequence. RON knockdown suppressed BC tumor growth in xenograft mouse tumors, accompanied by reduced expression of CXCR4.

Hormones and sex chromosomal differences are suggested to mediate these differences, but the functional skeletal muscle markers to document these differences are unknown. We show that the myogenic microRNA miR-486 is a marker of sex-specific differences in cancer-induced skeletal muscle defects. Cancer-induced loss of circulating miR-486 was more severe in men with bladder, lung, and pancreatic cancers compared to women with the same cancer types. In a syngeneic model of pancreatic cancer, circulating and skeletal muscle loss of miR-486 was more severe in male mice compared to female mice. Estradiol (E2) and the clinically used selective estrogen receptor modulator toremifene increased miR-486 in undifferentiated and differentiated myoblast cell line C2C12 and E2-inducible expression correlated with direct binding of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) to the regulatory region of the miR-486 gene. E2 and toremifene reduced the actions of cytokines such as myostatin, transforming growth factor beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which mediate cancer-induced skeletal muscle wasting. E2- and toremifene-treated C2C12 myoblast/myotube cells contained elevated levels of active protein kinase B (AKT) with a corresponding decrease in the levels of its negative regulator PTEN, which is a target of miR-486.

We aimed to study the relationship between prothrombin G20210A (PT20210) and factor V Leiden (FVL) mutations and the progression of fibrosis and liver function in chronic HCV patients. METHODS: The study included 100 subjects, 88 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis (compensated: 38, decompensated: 50), and 12 controls. Patients with other viral hepatitis or coinfection, inherited metabolic disease, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic or extrahepatic malignancy, in addition to patients with causes of hypoalbuminemia, elevated bilirubin or prolonged INR not related to cirrhosis were excluded from the study. Relevant clinical data were collected and basic laboratory tests were performed. Liver fibrosis was assessed using APRI and FIB-4 scores. FVL and PT20210 mutations were analyzed. RESULTS: FVL and PT20210 mutations were significantly higher in decompensated vs. compensated patients (32% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.001; 20% vs. 5.3%, 0.043, respectively) and absent in controls. Both mutations significantly correlated to the duration of infection, platelet count and fibrosis scores. PT20210 mutation significantly correlated to serum albumin and INR. Both mutations significantly predicted fibrosis scores, especially PT20210 (AUROC: 0.833 for APRI and 0.895 for FIB-4).

This analysis was conducted by using logistic regression under an additive genetic model with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, and the first 5 principal components derived from genotypic data. We then analyzed data from 2 cohorts of Latino children and adolescents for replication and conducted quantitative trait locus and functional annotation analyses. RESULTS: At the chromosome 6p21.3 locus, the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs56151658 (8 kb from the promoter of HLA-DQB1) was most significantly associated with asthma hospitalizations (for test allele A, odds ratio = 1.36 [95% CI = 1.22-1.52]; P = 3.11 x 10-8); 21 additional SNPs in this locus were associated with asthma hospitalizations at a P value less than 1 x 10-6. In the replication cohorts, multiple SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs56151658 were associated with severe asthma exacerbations at a P value of .01 or less in the same direction of association as in the discovery cohort.

We investigated a consanguineous family with recurrent pregnancy loss due to severe early-onset non-immune hydrops fetalis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole exome sequencing in four fetuses with hydrops fetalis revealed that they were homozygous for the angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) variant Chr8 (GRCh37/Hg19): 6385085T>C, NM_001147.2:c.557A>G. The substitution introduces a cryptic, exonic splice site predicted to result in loss of 10 nucleotides with subsequent shift in reading frame, leading to a premature stop codon. RNA analysis in the heterozygous parents demonstrated loss of detectable mutant allele, indicative of loss-of-function via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Serum ANGPT2 levels were reduced in the parents. In a pregnancy with a healthy, heterozygous child, transiently increased fetal nuchal translucency was noted. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic heterozygous ANGPT2 missense variants were recently shown to cause autosomal dominant primary lymphoedema. ANGPT2 is a ligand of the TIE1-TIE2 (tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and epidermal growth factor-like domains 1 and 2) pathway. It is critical to the formation and remodelling of blood and lymphatic vessels and is involved in vessel maintenance. ANGPT2 knockout mice die from generalised lymphatic dysfunction.

However, the bioactive components of XBJI and the mechanisms responsible for its sepsis-mitigating action have not been experimentally determined. One of the main bioactive compounds in XBJI-benzoylpaeoniflorin (BPF)-inhibits the expressions of key mediators of inflammation such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), and COX-2. However, its effects on sepsis have not been determined yet. Therefore, here, we investigated the immunomodulatory effect of BPF on severely inflamed endothelial cells, THP-1 macrophages, peritoneal macrophages, and mice. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and THP-1-macrophages were activated using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after pretreatment with BPF. Subsequently, changes in the expression profiles of pro-inflammatory molecules including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, we monitored the phosphorylation of NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) to determine their activation levels. Using the LPS-induced mouse model of sepsis, we studied the effects of BPF on inflammatory cytokine production, pulmonary histopathology, and survival rates. Finally, we evaluated whether BPF protects against cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, as it closely mimics human sepsis. BPF pretreatment inhibited LPS-induced increase in mRNA and protein levels of iNOS, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in HUVECs and THP-1-macrophages. It also suppressed LPS-mediated phosphorylation of p65, p38, JNK, and ERK. Mice with LPS-induced-sepsis who were treated with BPF had lower serum levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, CXCL1, and CXCL2 than the control mice treated with BPF. Histopathology revealed that BPF treatment alleviated LPS-induced lung damage. In addition, in mice given a lethal dose of LPS, BPF treatment showed a dose-dependent improvement in survival rates. BPF treatment dose-dependently inhibited the LPS-induced IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CXCL1 production in peritoneal macrophages. BPF treatment also dose-dependently improved the survival rates in mice with CLP-induced sepsis. These results show that BPF alleviates LPS-stimulated septic conditions and protects mice from CLP-induced sepsis.

Translatome analyses revealed that i14G1s mimic eIF1 and eIF4G1 perturbations on the stringency of start codon selection and the opposing roles of eIF1-eIF4G1 in scanning-dependent and scanning-independent short 5' untranslated region (UTR) translation. Remarkably, i14G1s activate ER/unfolded protein response (UPR) stress-response genes via enhanced ribosome loading, elevated 5'UTR translation at near-cognate AUGs, and unexpected concomitant up-regulation of coding-region translation. These effects are, at least in part, independent of eIF2alpha-phosphorylation. Interestingly, eIF4G1-eIF1 interaction itself is negatively regulated by ER stress and mTOR inhibition.

Yet, similar to the beneficial effects of mild hypoxia, non-toxic levels of iron depletion, achieved with the iron chelator bipyridine or through frataxin silencing, extend C. elegans lifespan through hypoxia-like induction of mitophagy. While the positive health outcomes of hypoxia preconditioning are evident, its practical application is rather challenging. Here, we thus test the potential beneficial effects of non-toxic, preconditioning interventions acting on iron instead of oxygen availability. We find that limiting iron availability through the iron competing agent cobalt chloride has evolutionarily conserved dose-dependent beneficial effects: while high doses of cobalt chloride have toxic effects in mammalian cells, iPS-derived neurospheres, and in C. elegans, sub-lethal doses protect against hypoxia- or cobalt chloride-induced death in mammalian cells and extend lifespan and delay age-associated neuromuscular alterations in C. elegans. The beneficial effects of cobalt chloride are accompanied by the activation of protective mitochondrial stress response pathways.", "pmid": "36393859"}

This could explain why multiple organs are affected in this enigmatic disorder. Lipid peroxides produced by the placenta are probably the first factors that activate neutrophils as they circulate through the intervillous space, but then a second factor specific to pregnancy comes into play, protease-activated receptor 1. The only time neutrophils express protease-activated receptor 1 is during pregnancy. This means that neutrophils can be activated by a mechanism specific to pregnancy, that is, by proteases. Two proteases that are elevated in preeclampsia and activate protease-activated receptor 1 are matrix metalloproteinase-1 and neutrophil elastase. There is an 8-fold increase in vascular protease-activated receptor 1 expression in women with preeclampsia, and protease-activated receptor 1 is also expressed on the placenta, a pregnancy-specific tissue. The question arises if the pregnancy-specific expression of protease-activated receptor 1 is essential to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Protease activation of protease-activated receptor 1 in neutrophils of women with normal pregnancies causes activation of RhoA kinase. RhoA kinase phosphorylates nuclear factor-kappa B causing its translocation from the cytosol into the nucleus, increasing the expression of inflammatory genes. This signaling pathway is blocked by inhibition of either protease-activated receptor 1 or RhoA kinase activity. In contrast, neutrophils obtained from preeclamptic women are already activated, with nuclear factor-kappa B localized in the nucleus. Surprisingly, inhibition of either protease-activated receptor 1 or RhoA kinase results in an efflux of nuclear factor-kappa B from the nucleus back into the cytoplasm. Cyclooxygenase-2 seems to be a downstream mediator between protease-activated receptor 1 and RhoA kinase because aspirin inhibits the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B and inhibits neutrophil production of superoxide, thromboxane, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Currently, low-dose aspirin is the standard of care to prevent preeclampsia in high-risk women. Generally, the actions of low-dose aspirin are attributed to selective inhibition of maternal platelet thromboxane production. However, a recent study showed that beneficial effects extend to the placenta, where aspirin corrected the imbalance of increased thromboxane and reduced prostacyclin and oxidative stress. Selective inhibition of placental thromboxane is possible because thromboxane and prostacyclin are compartmentalized. Thromboxane is produced by trophoblast cells and prostacyclin by endothelial cells, so as aspirin crosses the placenta, its levels decline, sparing prostacyclin. Placental oxidative stress is attenuated because cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition decreases the generation of reactive oxygen species to decrease the formation of isoprostanes. The clinical manifestations of preeclampsia can be explained by protease activation of protease-activated receptor 1 in different tissues. In neutrophils, it can account for their activation and inflammatory response. In vascular tissue, protease-activated receptor 1 activation leads to enhanced vascular reactivity to angiotensin II to cause hypertension. In the placenta, it leads to oxidative stress, increased soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase, and thromboxane production. Activation of protease-activated receptor 1 on endothelial cells causes contraction, leading to edema and proteinuria, and activation on platelets leads to coagulation abnormalities. As proteases that activate protease-activated receptor 1 are elevated in the circulation of women with preeclampsia, consideration should be given to the inhibition of protease-activated receptor 1 as a treatment. Recently, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a protease-activated receptor 1 inhibitor, creating an opportunity to test whether protease-activated receptor 1 inhibition can prevent and/or treat preeclampsia, but a standard dose of aspirin might be just as effective by blocking its downstream actions.", "pmid": "35177224"}

Cisplatin-induced oxidative stress plays a causal role in cochlear apoptosis while the consequent nitrative stress leads to the nitration of LIM domain only 4 (LMO4), a transcriptional regulator, and decreases its cochlear expression levels. Here, we show a direct link between cochlear LMO4 and cisplatin-induced hearing loss by employing a Lmo4 conditional knockout mouse model (Lmo4lox/lox; Gfi1Cre/+). Hair cell-specific deletion of Lmo4 did not alter cochlear morphology or affect hearing thresholds and otoacoustic emissions, in the absence of apoptotic stimuli. Cisplatin treatment significantly elevated the auditory brainstem response thresholds of conditional knockouts, across all frequencies. Moreover, deletion of Lmo4 compromised the activation of STAT3, a downstream target that regulates anti-apoptotic machinery. Immunostaining indicated that the expression of phosphorylated STAT3 was significantly decreased while the expression of activated caspase 3 was significantly increased in Lmo4 deficient hair cells, post-cisplatin treatment. These findings suggest an otoprotective role of LMO4 as cisplatin-induced decrease in cochlear LMO4 could compromise the LMO4/STAT3 cellular defense mechanism to induce ototoxicity.", "pmid": "33411315"}

Despite common mechanistic similarities between the isoforms, the extent of their redundancy is unclear. We found that depletion of PI4KIIa and PI4KIIb using small interfering RNA led to actin remodeling. Depletion of PI4KIIb also induced the formation of invadopodia containing membrane type I matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). Depletion of PI4KII isoforms also differentially affected trans-Golgi network (TGN) pools of PI(4)P and post-TGN traffic. PI4KIIb depletion caused increased MT1-MMP trafficking to invasive structures at the plasma membrane and was accompanied by reduced colocalization of MT1-MMP with membranes containing the endosomal markers Rab5 and Rab7 but increased localization with the exocytic Rab8. Depletion of PI4KIIb was sufficient to confer an aggressive invasive phenotype on minimally invasive HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines. Mining oncogenomic databases revealed that loss of the PI4K2B allele and underexpression of PI4KIIb mRNA are associated with human cancers. This finding supports the cell data and suggests that PI4KIIb may be a clinically significant suppressor of invasion. We propose that PI4KIIb synthesizes a pool of PI(4)P that maintains MT1-MMP traffic in the degradative pathway and suppresses the formation of invadopodia.", "pmid": "27798239"}

We examined whether intrarenal arterial transplantation of dexmedetomidine (DEX) preconditioning ADSC-derived microvesicles (DEX-MVs) could promote further therapeutic potential to reduce renal IR injury. We evaluated the effect of DEX-MVs on NRK-52E cells migration, hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cell death, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) amount and renal IR model in rats. IR was established by bilateral 45 min ischemia followed by 4 h reperfusion. Intrarenal MVs or DEX-MVs were administered prior to ischemia. Renal oxidative stress, hemodynamics and function, western blot, immunohistochemistry, and tubular injury scores were determined. The miR-122-5p expression in kidneys was analyzed using microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR and its action target was predicted by TargetScan. DEX-MVs were more efficient than MVs to increase migration capability and to further decrease H/R-induced cell death and ROS level in NRK-52E cells. Consistently, DEX-MVs were better than MV in increasing CD44 expression, improving IR-depressed renal hemodynamics and renal erythropoietin expression, inhibiting IR-enhanced renal ROS level, tubular injury score, miR-122-5p expression, pNF-kappaB expression, Bax/caspase 3/poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-mediated apoptosis, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels. The use of NRK-52E cells confirmed that miR-122-5p mimic via inhibiting erythropoietin expression exacerbated Bax-mediated apoptosis, whereas miR-122-5p inhibitor via upregulating erythropoietin and Bcl-2 expression reduced apoptosis. In summary, intrarenal arterial DEX-MV conferred further therapeutic potential to reduce renal IR injury through the miR-122-5p/erythropoietin/apoptosis axis.", "pmid": "36139786"}

The effect of SAA1 on the inflammatory activation of endothelial cells was investigated by detecting the expression of inflammatory factors and adhesion molecules. The role of SAA1 in formation of foam cells was verified by detecting lipid deposition and expression of molecules related to the formation of foam cells. After platelets were stimulated by SAA1, the aggregation rate was evaluated to determine the effect of SAA1 on platelet aggregation. Monocytes/platelets were cocultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) pretreated with or without SAA1 to determine whether SAA1 affected monocyte/platelet adhesion to endothelial cells. By inhibiting toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) function, we further identified the role of TLR4 signaling in SAA1-mediated endothelial inflammatory activation, foam-cell formation, and monocyte/platelet adhesion to HUVECs. SAA1 significantly increased the expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory factors in HUVECs. Moreover, SAA1 also promoted lipid deposition and the expression of inflammatory factors and low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) in THP-1-derived macrophages. In addition, SAA1 induced platelet aggregation and enhanced monocyte/platelet adhesion to HUVECs. However, the TLR4 antagonist significantly inhibited SAA1-induced endothelial cell activation, foam-cell formation, and monocyte/platelet adhesion to HUVECs and downregulated the expression of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), phosphor-inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB kinase subunit alpha/beta (P-IKKalpha/beta), phospho-inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB subunit alpha (P-IKBalpha), and phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB p65 (P-p65) in SAA1-induced HUVECs and THP-1 cells. Conclusively, it is speculated that SAA1 promotes atherosclerosis through enhancing endothelial cell activation, platelet aggregation, foam-cell formation, and monocyte/platelet adhesion to endothelial cells. These biological functions of SAA1 may depend on the activation of TLR4-related nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway.", "pmid": "36158875"}

We have previously documented that the transcription factor FOXF2 is highly expressed in human foreskin. Moreover, Foxf2 knockout mice present with cleft palate in combination with hypoplasia of the genital tubercle. We hypothesized that humans with disorders of sex development (DSD) in combination with cleft palate could have mutations in the FOXF2 gene. Eighteen children with DSD and cleft palate were identified in the L beck DSD database (about 1,500 entries). Genomic DNA sequence analysis of the FOXF2 gene was performed and compared with 10 normal female and 10 normal male controls, respectively. Two heterozygous DNA sequence variations were solely present in one single patient each but in none of the 20 normal controls: a duplication of GCC (c.97GCC[9]+[10]) resulting in an extra alanine within exon 1 and a 25*G>A substitution in the 3'-untranslated region. Two patients carried a c.262G>A sequence variation predicting for an Ala88Thr exchange which was also detected in 2 normal controls. Two silent mutations, c.1272C>T (Ser424Ser) and c.1284T>C (Tyr428Tyr), respectively, occurred in the coding region of exon 2, again in both patients and normal controls. In conclusion, the majority of the detected sequence alterations were polymorphisms without obvious functional relevance.

Multisubunit outer dynein arm (ODA) motor complexes, produced and preassembled in the cytosol, are transported to the ciliary or flagellar compartment and anchored into the axonemal microtubular scaffold via the ODA docking complex (ODA-DC) system. In humans, defects in ODA assembly are the major cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), an inherited disorder of ciliary and flagellar dysmotility characterized by chronic upper and lower respiratory infections and defects in laterality. Here, by combined high-throughput mapping and sequencing, we identified CCDC151 loss-of-function mutations in five affected individuals from three independent families whose cilia showed a complete loss of ODAs and severely impaired ciliary beating. Consistent with the laterality defects observed in these individuals, we found Ccdc151 expressed in vertebrate left-right organizers. Homozygous zebrafish ccdc151(ts272a) and mouse Ccdc151(Snbl) mutants display a spectrum of situs defects associated with complex heart defects. We demonstrate that CCDC151 encodes an axonemal coiled coil protein, mutations in which abolish assembly of CCDC151 into respiratory cilia and cause a failure in axonemal assembly of the ODA component DNAH5 and the ODA-DC-associated components CCDC114 and ARMC4. CCDC151-deficient zebrafish, planaria, and mice also display ciliary dysmotility accompanied by ODA loss.

Mild hypothermia and COVID-19.", "abstract": "PURPOSE: The pathophysiology theories of COVID-19 attach the injury of target organs to faulty immune responses and occasionally hyper-inflammation. The damage frequently extends beyond the respiratory system, accompanying cardiovascular, renal, central nervous system, and/or coagulation derangements. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins (IL)-1 and - 6 suppression may improve outcomes, as experimentally shown. Targeted therapies have been proposed, but mild therapeutic hypothermia-a more multifaceted approach-could be suitable. FINDINGS: According to evidence derived from previous applications, therapeutic hypothermia diminishes the release of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in serum and at the tissue level. PaCO2 is reduced and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is increased, possibly lasting after rewarming. Cooling might mitigate both ventilator and infectious-induced lung injury, and suppress microthrombi development, enhancing V/Q mismatch. Improvements in microhemodynamics and tissue O2 diffusion, along with the ischemia-tolerance heightening of tissues, could be reached. Arrhythmia incidence diminishes. Moreover, hypothermia may address the coagulopathy, promoting normalization of both hypo- and hyper-coagulability patterns, which are apparently sustained after a return to normothermia. CONCLUSIONS: As per prior therapeutic hypothermia literature, the benefits regarding inflammatory response and organic damage might be seen. Following the safety-cornerstones of the technique, the overall infection rate and infection-related mortality are not expected to rise, and increased viral replication does not seem to be a concern. Therefore, the possibility of a low cost and widely available therapy being capable of improving COVID-19 outcomes deserves further study.", "pmid": "33622611"}

It has been shown that genetic deletions of the various types of nAChRs impact the properties of ultra-slow transitions between high and low PFC activity states in mice during quiet wakefulness. The impact characteristics depend on specific interneuron populations expressing the manipulated receptor subtype. In addition, recent data indicate that a genetic mutation of the alpha5 nAChR subunit, located on vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) inhibitory neurons, the rs16969968 single nucleotide polymorphism (alpha5 SNP), plays a key role in the hypofrontality observed in schizophrenia patients carrying the SNP. Data also indicate that chronic nicotine application to alpha5 SNP mice relieves the hypofrontality. We developed a computational model to show that the activity patterns recorded in the genetically modified mice can be explained by changes in the dynamics of the local PFC circuit. Notably, our model shows that these altered PFC circuit dynamics are due to changes in the stability structure of the activity states. We identify how this stability structure is differentially modulated by cholinergic inputs to the parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM) or the VIP inhibitory populations. Our model uncovers that a change in amplitude, but not duration of the high activity states can account for the lowered pyramidal (PYR) population firing rates recorded in alpha5 SNP mice. We demonstrate how nicotine-induced desensitization and upregulation of the beta2 nAChRs located on SOM interneurons, as opposed to the activation of alpha5 nAChRs located on VIP interneurons, is sufficient to explain the nicotine-induced activity normalization in alpha5 SNP mice. The model further implies that subsequent nicotine withdrawal may exacerbate the hypofrontality over and beyond one caused by the SNP mutation.", "pmid": "34820636"}

The disease is characterized by wheezing, dyspnea, coughing, chest tightness and variable airflow limitation for which there is no cure and is symptomatically treated with inhaled corticosteroids and beta2-agonists. Molecular mechanisms underlying its complex pathogenesis are not fully understood. However, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1), a DNA repair protein may play a central role, as OGG1 deficiency decreases both innate and allergic inflammation. Methods: Using a murine ovalbumin (OVA) model of allergic airway inflammation we assessed the utility of an inhibitor of OGG1 (TH5487) in this disease context. Cytokines and chemokines, promoting immune cell recruitment were measured using a 23-multiplex assay and Western blotting. Additionally, immune cell recruitment to bronchi was measured using flow cytometry. Histological analyses and immunofluorescent staining were used to confirm immune cell influx and goblet cell hyperplasia of the airways. A PCR array was used to assess asthma-related genes in murine lung tissue following TH5487 treatment. Finally, airway hyperresponsiveness was determined using in vivo lung function measurement. Results: In this study, administration of TH5487 to mice with OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation significantly decreased goblet cell hyperplasia and mucus production. TH5487 treatment also decreased levels of activated NF-kappaB and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines resulting in significantly lower recruitment of eosinophils and other immune cells to the lungs. Gene expression profiling of asthma and allergy-related proteins after TH5487 treatment revealed differences in several important regulators, including down regulation of Tnfrsf4, Arg1, Ccl12 and Ccl11, and upregulation of the negative regulator of type 2 inflammation, Bcl6. Furthermore, the gene Clca1 was upregulated following TH5487 treatment, which should be explored further due to its ambiguous role in allergic asthma. In addition, the OVA-induced airway hyperresponsiveness was significantly reduced by TH5487 treatment.

XPO1 (chromosome region maintenance 1 or CRM1) mediates the nuclear export of several proteins, mainly tumor suppressors. Thus, XPO1 functions as a pro-oncogenic factor. KPT-330 (Selinexor) is a United States Food and Drug Administration approved selective inhibitor of XPO1 that demonstrates good therapeutic effects in hematologic cancers. However, the function of XPO1 and the effect of KPT-330 have not been reported in GBC. METHODS: We analyzed the correlation between XPO1 expression levels by q-PCR and clinical features of GBC patients. Cell proliferation assays were used to analyze the in vitro antitumor effects of XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330. mRNA sequencing was used to explore the underlying mechanisms. Western blot was performed to explore the relationship between apoptosis and autophagy. The in vivo antitumor effect of KPT-330 was investigated in a nude mouse model of gallbladder cancer. RESULTS: We found that high expression of XPO1 was related to poor prognosis of GBC patients. We observed that XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 inhibited the proliferation of GBC cells in vitro. Furthermore, XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 induced apoptosis by reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential and triggering autophagy in NOZ and GBC-SD cells. Indeed, XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 led to nuclear accumulation of p53 and activated the p53/mTOR pathway to regulate autophagy-dependent apoptosis.

However, the prognostic role of VDR expression or its relationship with PIK3CA or KRAS mutation remains uncertain. Among 619 colorectal cancers in two prospective cohort studies, 233 (38%) tumors showed VDR overexpression by immunohistochemistry. We analyzed for PIK3CA and KRAS mutations and LINE-1 methylation by Pyrosequencing, microsatellite instability (MSI), and DNA methylation (epigenetic changes) in eight CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-specific promoters [CACNA1G, CDKN2A (p16), CRABP1, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1] by MethyLight (real-time PCR). VDR overexpression was significantly associated with KRAS mutation (odds ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.16) and PIK3CA mutation (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-3.47), both of which persisted in multivariate logistic regression analysis.

We found that CDK4/6 bind and phosphorylate the p53 family member p73 at threonine 86, which sequesters p73 in the cytoplasm. Inhibition of CDK4/6 led to dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p73, which transcriptionally activated death receptor 5 (DR5), a cytokine receptor and key component of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. p73-mediated induction of DR5 by CDK4/6 inhibitors promoted immunogenic cell death of cancer cells.

We performed a retrospective single-center observational study in 265/354 screened patients admitted for alloHCT from June 2015 to August 2019. All were examined by a low-dose CT thorax scan at admission (CT t0) and after stable neutrophil recovery (CT t1) to determine the incidences of IFD. Furthermore, antifungal prophylaxis medications were recorded and cohorts were analyzed for statistical differences in IFD incidence using the sequential CT scans. In addition, IFD cases were classified according to EORTC 2008. At CT t0 in 9.6% of the patients, an IFD was detected and antifungal therapy initiated. The cumulative incidence of IFD in CT t1 in our department was 14%. The use of Aspergillus-effective prophylaxis through voriconazole or posaconazole decreased CT thorax t1 suggesting IFD is statistically significant compared to prophylaxis with fluconazole (5.6% asp-azol group vs 16.3% fluconazole group, p = 0.048).

Here, we report a reduction in the retromer proteins-vacuolar protein sorting 35 (VPS35), VPS26A, and VPS29-in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in the ALS model provided by transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the mutant superoxide dismutase-1 G93A. These changes are accompanied by a reduction of levels of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunit GluA1, a proxy of retromer function, in spinal cords from Tg SOD1G93A mice. Correction of the retromer deficit by a viral vector expressing VPS35 exacerbates the paralytic phenotype in Tg SOD1G93A mice. Conversely, lowering Vps35 levels in Tg SOD1G93A mice ameliorates the disease phenotype. In light of these findings, we propose that mild alterations in retromer inversely modulate neurodegeneration propensity in ALS.", "pmid": "35749364"}

Ferroptosis is a newly discovered type of cell death resulting from iron-dependent lipid peroxide accumulation. The purpose of this study was to examine whether ferroptosis is involved in COPD-associated skeletal muscle dysfunction. Methods: A mouse model of COPD was established after 24 weeks of cigarette smoke (CS) exposure, and mRNA sequencing, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, immunostaining (IF), RT-PCR, and Western blot were utilized to identify the changes in gastrocnemius muscles. In vitro, C2C12 myotubes were treated with CS extract (CSE) and evaluated for ferroptosis-related molecules. The pathways regulating ferroptosis were then explored in CSE-stimulated myotubes. Results: Compared with controls, COPD mice showed an enriched ferroptosis pathway. Gpx4 was decreased, while hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif) 2alpha was increased, at gene and protein levels. A reduced level of GSH, but increased cell death, Fe2+, lipid ROS, LPO, and 4-HNE were observed in COPD mice or in CSE-stimulated C2C12 myotubes, which could be ameliorated by ferroptosis inhibitors. The expression of myostatin (MSTN) was enhanced in COPD mice and CSE-stimulated myotubes. MSTN up-regulated HIF2alpha expression and led to ferroptosis in myotubes, whereas inhibition of MSTN binding to its receptor or inhibition/knockdown of HIF2alpha resulted in decreased cell death, and partially restored GPX4 and GSH. Conclusion: CS exposure induced ferroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, CS-exposure upregulated MSTN which further induced ferroptosis through HIF2alpha in skeletal muscles, which may contribute to muscle dysfunction through impairing metabolic capacity and decreasing muscle fiber numbers, revealing a potential novel therapeutic target for COPD-related skeletal muscle dysfunction.", "pmid": "36185172"}

We investigated the genetic overlap and associations between headache and thyroid function traits using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. We found a significant genetic correlation (rg) with headache and hypothyroidism (rg = 0.09, p = 2.00 x 10-4), free thyroxine (fT4) (rg = 0.08, p = 5.50 x 10-3), and hyperthyroidism (rg = -0.14, p = 1.80 x 10-3), a near significant genetic correlation with secondary hypothyroidism (rg = 0.20, p = 5.24 x 10-2), but not with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Pairwise-GWAS analysis revealed six, 14, four and five shared (pleiotropic) loci with headache and hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, secondary hypothyroidism, and fT4, respectively. Cross-trait GWAS meta-analysis identified novel genome-wide significant loci for headache: five with hypothyroidism, three with secondary hypothyroidism, 12 with TSH, and nine with fT4.

PACAP binds with high affinity to PAC1, which causes transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) for the EGFR and HER2 but its effect on HER3 is unknown. Using 3 NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H358, NCI-H441, and Calu-3), proteins for EGFR, HER2, HER3, and PAC1 were detected. The increase in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation caused by PACAP was blocked by the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib, or PACAP(6-38), a PAC1 antagonist. The increase in HER2 tyrosine phosphorylation caused by PACAP was inhibited by trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) for HER2, or PACAP(6-38). The increase in HER3 tyrosine phosphorylation caused by PACAP was inhibited by HER3 mAb3481 or PACAP(6-38). Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated the PACAP addition to Calu-3 cells resulted in the formation of EGFR/HER3 and HER2/HER3 heterodimers. Addition of the HER3 agonist neuregulin (NRG)-1 increased HER3 tyrosine phosphorylation in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. PACAP or NRG-1 increased the proliferation of NSCLC cells, whereas PACAP(6-38), gefitinib, trastuzumab, or mAb3481 inhibited proliferation.

However, about 60% of these patients show innate resistance to cetuximab. To increase cetuximab efficacy, it is crucial to successfully identify responder patients, as well as to develop new therapeutic approaches to overcome cetuximab resistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the value of EGFR effector phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCgamma1) in predicting cetuximab responses, by analyzing progression-free survival (PFS) of a multicentric retrospective cohort of 94 treated patients with mCRC (log-rank test and Cox regression model). Furthermore, we used in vitro and zebrafish xenotransplant models to identify and target the mechanism behind PLCgamma1-mediated resistance to cetuximab. RESULTS: In this study, levels of PLCgamma1 were found increased in RAS WT tumors and were able to predict cetuximab responses in clinical samples and in vitro and in vivo models. Mechanistically, PLCgamma1 expression was found to bypass cetuximab-dependent EGFR inhibition by activating ERK and AKT pathways. This novel resistance mechanism involves a noncatalytic role of PLCgamma1 SH2 tandem domains in the propagation of downstream signaling via SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2). Accordingly, SHP2 inhibition sensitizes PLCgamma1-resistant cells to cetuximab. CONCLUSIONS: Our discoveries reveal the potential of PLCgamma1 as a predictive biomarker for cetuximab responses and suggest an alternative therapeutic approach to circumvent PLCgamma1-mediated resistance to cetuximab in patients with RAS WT mCRC. In this way, this work contributes to the development of novel strategies in the medical management and treatment of patients with mCRC.", "pmid": "34980600"}

Based on their role in inflammatory responses, particularly in the lung and skin, MCs provide an effective target for anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies. Drug-delivery of lipophilic payloads to MCs can be challenging due to their functionally distinct intracellular structures. In the present study, pH-sensitive cationic lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) composed of DODMA, DODAP or DOTAP lipids that encapsulated a GFP or eGFP plasmid were constructed using non-turbulent microfluidic mixing. This approach achieved up to 75-92% encapsulation efficiency. Dynamic light scattering revealed a uniformly sized and homogeneous dispersion of LNPs. To promote cellular internalization, LNPs were complexed with apolipoproteins, amphipathic proteins capable of binding lipids and facilitating their transport into cells. Cryo-TEM analysis showed that LNP structure was differentially modified when associated with different types of apolipoproteins. LNP preparations made up of DODMA or DODMA, DODAP and DOTAP lipids were coated with seven apolipoproteins (Apo A1, B, C3, D, E2, E4 and H). Differentiated bone-marrow derived mouse mast cells (BMMCs) were exposed to apolipoprotein-LNP and internalization was measured using flow cytometry. Out of all the apolipoproteins tested, ApoC3 most efficiently facilitated cellular internalization of the LNP into BMMCs as determined by GFP fluorescence using flow cytometry. These effects were confirmed in a less differentiated but also interleukin-3-dependent model of mouse mast cells, MC/9. ApoC3-LNP enhanced internalization by BMMC in a concentration-dependent manner and this was significantly increased when BMMC were pre-treated with inhibitors of actin polymerization, suggesting a dependence on intracellular shuttling. Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) decreased ApoC3-LNP internalization and reduced the expression of apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), suggesting that ApoC3-LNP binding to ApoER2 may be responsible for its enhanced internalization. Furthermore, ApoC3 fails to facilitate internalization of LNPs in Lrp8-/- KO BMMC that do not express ApoER2 on their cell surface. Altogether, our studies reveal an important role of ApoC3 in facilitating internalization of cationic LNPs into MCs.", "pmid": "36624108"}

Although type I interferon (IFN-I) has been proven to control EV71 replication, the key downstream IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) remains to be clarified and investigated. Recently, we found that 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetases 3 (OAS3), as one of ISG of IFN-beta1b, was antagonized by EV71 3C protein. Here, we confirm that OAS3 is the major determinant of IFN-beta1b-mediated EV71 inhibition, which depends on the downstream constitutive RNase L activation. 2'-5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthesis activity deficient mutations of OAS3 D816A, D818A, D888A, and K950A lost resistance to EV71 because they could not activate downstream RNase L. Further investigation proved that EV71 infection induced OAS3 but not RNase L expression by IFN pathway. Mechanically, EV71 or IFN-beta1b-induced phosphorylation of STAT1, but not STAT3, initiated the transcription of OAS3 by directly binding to the OAS3 promoter.

Their incidence is increasing with global population aging. Although many genetic, epigenetic, splicing, and metabolic aberrations have been identified in patients with MDS, their clinical features are quite similar. Here, we show that hypoxia-independent activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1A) signaling is both necessary and sufficient to induce dysplastic and cytopenic MDS phenotypes. The HIF1A transcriptional signature is generally activated in MDS patient bone marrow stem/progenitors. Major MDS-associated mutations (Dnmt3a, Tet2, Asxl1, Runx1, and Mll1) activate the HIF1A signature. Although inducible activation of HIF1A signaling in hematopoietic cells is sufficient to induce MDS phenotypes, both genetic and chemical inhibition of HIF1A signaling rescues MDS phenotypes in a mouse model of MDS. These findings reveal HIF1A as a central pathobiologic mediator of MDS and as an effective therapeutic target for a broad spectrum of patients with MDS.Significance: We showed that dysregulation of HIF1A signaling could generate the clinically relevant diversity of MDS phenotypes by functioning as a signaling funnel for MDS driver mutations.

We targeted the key metabolic player proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) using a pharmacological inhibitor (R-IMPP) alone or in combination with 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor, simvastatin. We assessed the effect of these treatments using 3 hepatoma cell lines, Huh6, Huh7 and HepG2 and a tumor xenograft in chicken choriorallantoic membrane (CAM) model. PCSK9 deficiency led to dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in all cell lines and a decrease in cell migration. Co-treatment with simvastatin presented synergetic anti-proliferative effects. At the metabolic level, mitochondrial respiration assays as well as the assessment of glucose and glutamine consumption showed higher metabolic adaptability and surge in the absence of PCSK9. Enhanced lipid uptake and biogenesis led to excessive accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets as revealed by electron microscopy and metabolic tracing. Using xenograft experiments in CAM model, we further demonstrated the effect of anti-PCSK9 treatment in reducing tumor aggressiveness.

The study included 232 patients with unstable angina. The diagnosis of unstable angina was made by typical clinical presentation and confirmation of significant coronary artery lumen stenosis (>70%) during coronary angiography. There were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of TGFBR2 rs6785358 and rs9838682 genotypes and haplotypes between patients with unstable angina and control subjects. We observed increased values of plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels, as well as triglycerides, in patients with the TGFBR2 rs9838682 AA genotype.

Less is known about how those influences are translated into molecular mechanisms regulating insulin production. To better understand the molecular mechanisms we generated marked cells homozygous for a null mutation in the Drosophila TGF-beta signal transducer dSmad2 in unmated adult females. We then conducted side-by-side single cell comparisons of the pixel intensity of two Drosophila insulin-like peptides (dILP2 and dILP5) in dSmad2- mutant and wild type insulin producing cells (IPCs). The analysis revealed multiple features of dSmad2 regulation of dILPs. In addition, we discovered that dILP5 is expressed and regulated by dSmad2 in circadian pacemaker cells (CPCs). Outcomes of regulation by dSmad2 differ between dILP2 and dILP5 within IPCs and differ for dILP5 between IPCs and CPCs. Modes of dSmad2 regulation differ between dILP2 and dILP5. dSmad2 antagonism of dILP2 in IPCs is robust but dSmad2 regulation of dILP5 in IPCs and CPCs toggles between antagonism and agonism depending upon dSmad2 dosage. Companion studies of dILP2 and dILP5 in the IPCs of dCORL mutant (fussel in Flybase and SKOR in mammals) and upd2 mutant unmated adult females showed no significant difference from wild type.

Lung injury is a known risk factor for the development of posttraumatic complications, but information on the long-term course of the pulmonary inflammatory response and treatment with mild hypothermia are scarce. AIM: To investigate the pulmonary inflammatory response to multiple trauma and hemorrhagic shock in a porcine model of combined trauma and to assess the immunomodulatory properties of mild hypothermia. METHODS: Following induction of trauma (blunt chest trauma, liver laceration, tibia fracture), two degrees of hemorrhagic shock (45 and 50%) over 90 (n = 30) and 120 min. (n = 20) were induced. Animals were randomized to hypothermia (33 C) or normothermia (38 C). We evaluated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and tissue levels of cytokines and investigated changes in microRNA- and gene-expression as well as tissue apoptosis. RESULTS: We observed a significant induction of Interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and Cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA in lung tissue. Likewise, an increased IL-6 protein concentration could be detected in BAL-fluid, with a slight decrease of IL-6 protein in animals treated with hypothermia. Lower IL-10 protein levels in normothermia and higher IL-10 protein concentrations in hypothermia accompanied this trend. Tissue apoptosis increased after trauma. However, intervention with hypothermia did not result in a meaningful reduction of pro-inflammatory biomarkers or tissue apoptosis.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that NAIP/NLRC4 is also activated in non-bacterial infections, and in sterile inflammation. Moreover, in addition to the well-established model for the detection of bacterial proteins by NAIP proteins, the participation of other cytosolic pathways in the regulation of NAIP/NLRC4-mediated responses has been reported in distinct contexts. Using pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion, we demonstrate here that cathepsins, well known for their involvement in NLRP3 activation, also regulate NAIP/NLRC4 responses to cytosolic flagellin in murine and human macrophages. In contrast to that observed for NLRP3 agonists, cathepsins inhibition did not reduce ASC speck formation or caspase-1 maturation in response to flagellin, ruling out their participation in the effector phase of NAIP/NLRC4 activation. Moreover, cathepsins had no impact on NF-kappaB-mediated priming of pro-IL-1beta, thus suggesting these proteases act downstream of the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome activation. IL-1beta levels secreted in response to flagellin were reduced in the absence of either cathepsins or Gasdermin-D (GSDMD), a molecule involved in the induction of pyroptosis and cytokines release. Notably, IL-1beta secretion was abrogated in the absence of both GSDMD and cathepsins, demonstrating their non-redundant roles for the optimal IL-1beta release in response to cytosolic flagellin. Given the central role of NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasomes in controlling infection and, also, induction of inflammatory pathologies, many efforts have been made to uncover novel molecules involved in their regulation.

We performed a case-control study to test the association between two polymorphisms in the hMSH2 gene: an A --> G transition at 127 position producing an Asn --> Ser substitution at codon 127 (the Asn127Ser polymorphism) and a G --> A transition at 1032 position resulting in a Gly --> Asp change at codon 322 (the Gly322Asp polymorphism) and breast cancer risk and cancer progression.

Although hepatic steatosis is a major risk factor for preservation type injury, how NKT cells impact this is understudied. Given NKT1 cell activation by phospholipid ligands recognized presented by CD1d, we hypothesized that NKT1 cells are key modulators of hepatic IRI because of the increased frequency of activating ligands in the setting of hepatic steatosis. We first demonstrate that IRI is exacerbated by a high-fat diet (HFD) in experimental murine models of warm partial ischemia. This is evident in the evaluation of ALT levels and Phasor-Fluorescence Lifetime (Phasor-FLIM) Imaging for glycolytic stress. Polychromatic flow cytometry identified pronounced increases in CD45+CD3+NK1.1+NKT1 cells in HFD fed mice when compared to mice fed a normal diet (ND). This observation is further extended to IRI, measuring ex vivo cytokine expression in the HFD and ND. Much higher interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression is noted in the HFD mice after IRI. We further tested our hypothesis by performing a lipidomic analysis of hepatic tissue and compared this to Phasor-FLIM imaging using \"long lifetime species\", a byproduct of lipid oxidation. There are higher levels of triacylglycerols and phospholipids in HFD mice. Since N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is able to limit hepatic steatosis, we tested how oral NAC supplementation in HFD mice impacted IRI. Interestingly, oral NAC supplementation in HFD mice results in improved hepatic enhancement using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to HFD control mice and normalization of glycolysis demonstrated by Phasor-FLIM imaging. This correlated with improved biochemical serum levels and a decrease in IFN-gamma expression at a tissue level and from CD45+CD3+CD1d+ cells.

Methods: The data of 135 patients with migraine were collected from January 2021 to December 2021. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism was analyzed. The pain intensity was evaluated using a numerical rating scale (NRS) during treatment. The levels of folic acid, homocysteine (Hcy), vitamin B12, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and ferritin, and changes of NRS were compared between folic acid and conventional treatment groups stratified by different genotypes of MTHFR in migraine patients. Results: The levels of Hcy and ferritin in male patients were higher than that in female patients (P < 0.05); Compared with CC and CT genotype groups, the TT genotype group showed significantly higher Hcy levels (P < 0.05) and lower folic acid levels (P < 0.05); In both folic acid and conventional treatment groups, a significant decrease in NRS score was observed in different genotypes post-treatment (P < 0.05). Patients with TT genotype in the folic acid treatment group showed better therapeutic efficacy than conventional treatment group (P < 0.05). There is no significant difference in the therapeutic efficacy in other genotypes between the two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The MTHFR C677T genotyping may provide a new method to guide and optimize individualized medication for migraine patients.", "pmid": "36619923"}

Exploiting different mechanisms of action, a novel triple drug delivery system of 5-fluorouracil, curcumin, and piperine co-loaded human serum albumin nanoparticles (5FU-CUR-PIP-HSA-NPs) was developed via the self-assembly method for suppressing breast tumor. Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs were successfully encapsulated in the HSA NPs with a high drug loading efficiency (DLE) of 10%. Successful clinical translation of nanomedicines, however, is a challenging process requiring considerable preclinical in vitro and in vivo animal tests. The aim of this study was to develop a homemade preclinical 3D culture model in the standard 96-well plates in a cost and time-effective novel approach for the rapid generation of homogenous compact tumor spheroids for disease modeling, and anticancer therapeutic/nanomedicine screening. The knowledge of drug screening can be enhanced by employing such a model in a high-throughput manner. Accordingly, to validate the formulated drug delivery system and investigate the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity effect of the nanoformulation, 3D tumor spheroids were employed. The practicality of the nanomedicine system was substantiated in different tests. The in vitro uptake of the NPs into the tight 3D tumor spheroids was facilitated by the semi-spherical shape of the NPs with a proper size and surface charge. 5FU-CUR-PIP-HSA-NPs demonstrated high potency of migration inhibition as a part of successful anti-metastatic therapy as well. The remarkable differences in 2D and 3D cytotoxicities emphasize the importance of employing 3D tumor models as an intermediate step prior to in vivo animal experiments for drug/nanomedicine screening.", "pmid": "36800370"}

However, its role in liver injury and fibrogenesis has not been elucidated so far. In this study, we determined the effects of SAA on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main fibrogenic cell type of the liver. Serum amyloid A potently activated IkappaB kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Erk and Akt and enhanced NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase activity in primary human and rat HSCs. Serum amyloid A induced the transcription of MCP-1, RANTES and MMP9 in an NF-kappaB- and JNK-dependent manner. Blockade of NF-kappaB revealed cytotoxic effects of SAA in primary HSCs with signs of apoptosis such as caspase 3 and PARP cleavage and Annexin V staining. Serum amyloid A induced HSC proliferation, which depended on JNK, Erk and Akt activity. In primary hepatocytes, SAA also activated MAP kinases, but did not induce relevant cell death after NF-kappaB inhibition. In two models of hepatic fibrogenesis, CCl4 treatment and bile duct ligation, hepatic mRNA levels of SAA1 and SAA3 were strongly increased. In conclusion, SAA may modulate fibrogenic responses in the liver in a positive and negative fashion by inducing inflammation, proliferation and cell death in HSCs.", "pmid": "26937641"}

Carfilzomib toxicity includes renal adverse effects (RAEs) of obscure pathobiology. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of nephrotoxicity developed by Carfilzomib. In a first experimental series, we used our previously established in vivo mouse models of Carfilzomib cardiotoxicity, that incorporated 2 and 4 doses of Carfilzomib, to identify whether Carfilzomib affects renal pathways. Hematology and biochemical analyses were performed, while kidneys underwent histological and molecular analyses. In a second and third experimental series, the 4 doses protocol was repeated for 24 hours urine collection and proteomic/metabolomic analyses. To test an experimental intervention, primary murine collecting duct tubular epithelial cells were treated with Carfilzomib and/or Eplerenone and Metformin. Finally, Eplerenone was orally co-administered with Carfilzomib daily (165 mg/kg) in the 4 doses protocol. We additionally used material from 7 patients to validate our findings and patients underwent biochemical analysis and assessment of renal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) axis activation. In vivo screening showed that Carfilzomib-induced renal histological deficits and increased serum creatinine, urea, NGAL levels, and proteinuria only in the 4 doses protocol. Carfilzomib decreased diuresis, altered renal metabolism, and activated MR axis. This was consistent with the cytotoxicity found in primary murine collecting duct tubular epithelial cells, whereas Carfilzomib + Eplerenone co-administration abrogated Carfilzomib-related nephrotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo. Renal SGK-1, a marker of MR activation, increased in patients with Carfilzomib-related RAEs. Conclusively, Carfilzomib-induced renal MR/SGK-1 activation orchestrates RAEs and water retention both in vivo and in the clinical setting.

The oil obtained from sucupira (Pterodon emarginatus) has anti-inflammatory properties, and the soybean lecithin reduces the intestinal toxicity of several xenobiotics. However, their water insolubility impairs the in vivo application. For this reason, we evaluated if the nanoencapsulation of sucupira oil (SO) in lecithin-based nanocapsules (SO-NC) could be a therapeutically effective system for the treatment of IM in murine cisplatin (CDDP)-induced intestinal mucositis model. SO was analyzed by LC-HRMS/MS and HPLC. SO-NC was prepared by nanoprecipitation and characterized using DLS, HPLC, and AFM. Mice body weight and food consumption were assessed daily during experimental mucositis induced by CDDP. The animals were euthanized, and intestinal permeability, inflammatory mediators, and intestinal histology were performed. SO-NC demonstrated adequate characteristics for oral administration as size under 300 nm, IP < 0.3, high EE, and spherical shape. In vitro cytotoxicity performed against RAW 264.7 cell lines resulted in cell viability above 80 % confirming the non-cytotoxic profile of SO (IC50 268 microg/mL) and SO-NC (IC50 118.5 microg/mL) up to 117.2 microg/mL. The untreated mice showed intestinal toxicity after i.p. of CDDP, principally weight loss, increased intestinal permeability, and MPO and TNF-alpha levels. Surprisingly, the administration of SO to CDDP-mucositis animals did not circumvent the CDDP effects and increased intestinal permeability. However, SO-NC proved efficient in mitigating the experimental intestinal mucositis by improving intestinal epithelium architecture, reducing intestinal permeability, and improving the MPO levels. In conclusion, SO-NC can positively impact intestinal mucositis by promoting mucosal recovery. This is a promising strategy for developing a new treatment for intestinal mucositis.", "pmid": "36518414"}

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 20 susceptibility loci for these conditions. However, potential sex differences in genetic associations with BE/EA remain largely unexplored. METHODS: Given strong genetic overlap, BE and EA cases were combined into a single case group for analysis. These were compared with population-based controls. We performed sex-specific GWAS of BE/EA in 3 separate studies and then used fixed-effects meta-analysis to provide summary estimates for >9 million variants for male and female individuals. A series of downstream analyses were conducted separately in male and female individuals to identify genes associated with BE/EA and the genetic correlations between BE/EA and other traits. RESULTS: We included 6758 male BE/EA cases, 7489 male controls, 1670 female BE/EA cases, and 6174 female controls. After Bonferroni correction, our meta-analysis of sex-specific GWAS identified 1 variant at chromosome 6q11.1 (rs112894788, KHDRBS2-MTRNR2L9, PBONF = .039) that was statistically significantly associated with BE/EA risk in male individuals only, and 1 variant at chromosome 8p23.1 (rs13259457, PRSS55-RP1L1, PBONF = 0.057) associated, at borderline significance, with BE/EA risk in female individuals only.

Concurrent AUD-AnxD poses a challenge for clinical management as approaches to treatment of one disorder may be ineffective or potentially counterproductive for the other disorder. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a middle-aged man with anxiety disorder, AUD, chronic pain, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate use in context of tapering prescribed benzodiazepines who experienced severe alcohol withdrawal episodes during a complicated course of repeated inpatient withdrawal management. After medical stabilization, the patient found significant improvement in symptoms and no return to alcohol use with a regimen of naltrexone targeting his AUD, gabapentin targeting both his AUD and AnxD, and engagement with integrated psychotherapy, Alcoholics Anonymous, and addictions medicine follow-up. CONCLUSION: Proper recognition and interventions for AUD and AnxD, ideally with overlapping efficacy, can benefit individuals with comorbid AUD-AnxD. Gabapentin, tobacco cessation, and integrated psychotherapy have preliminary evidence of synergistic effects in AUD-AnxD. Meta-analysis evidence does not support serotoninergic medications (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) which are commonly prescribed in AnxD and mood disorders as their use has not been associated with improved outcomes for AUD-AnxD. Additionally, several double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials have suggested that serotonergic medications may worsen alcohol-related outcomes in some individuals with AUD.

What remains unknown are the activating signals in glia, and how paracrine signals may be selective for a targeted neuron while sparing other proximate neurons. We studied these questions in the retina, where Muller glia contacts photoreceptors on one side and retinal ganglion cells on the other. In a mutant Rhodopsin mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) causing progressive photoreceptor death-but sparing retinal ganglion cells-TrkC.T1 and NT-3 ligand are upregulated in Muller glia. TrkC.T1 activity generates p-Erk, which causes increased TNF-alpha. These sequential events take place predominantly in Muller fibers contacting stressed photoreceptors, and culminate in selective death. Each event and photoreceptor death can be prevented by reduction of TrkC.T1 expression, by pharmacological antagonism of TrkC or by pharmacological inhibition Erk.

Telaglenastat, an investigational, small-molecule, glutaminase inhibitor, exhibits modest single-agent activity in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. This phase Ib trial evaluated telaglenastat plus cabozantinib or everolimus, agents known to impair glucose metabolism in patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: mRCC patients received escalating doses of telaglenastat [400-800 mg per os (p.o.) twice daily] in a 3 + 3 design, plus either everolimus (10 mg daily p.o.; TelaE) or cabozantinib (60 mg daily p.o.; TelaC). Tumor response (RECISTv1.1) was assessed every 8 weeks. Endpoints included safety (primary) and antitumor activity. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients received TelaE, 13 received TelaC, with median 2 and 3 prior therapies, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events were mostly grades 1 to 2, most common including decreased appetite, anemia, elevated transaminases, and diarrhea with TelaE, and diarrhea, decreased appetite, elevated transaminases, and fatigue with TelaC. One dose-limiting toxicity occurred per cohort: grade 3 pruritic rash with TelaE and thrombocytopenia with TelaC. No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached for either combination, leading to a recommended phase II dose of 800-mg telaglenastat twice daily with standard doses of E or C. TelaE disease control rate (DCR; response rate + stable disease) was 95.2% [20/21, including 1 partial response (PR)] among 21 patients with clear cell histology and 66.7% (2/3) for papillary.

Benefiting from the internal electric field induced by the spontaneously ferroelectric polarization of BTO, the photoexcited electrons and holes are driven to move in the opposite direction inside BTO, and the electrons are transferred to Ti3C2T x across the Schottky interface. Thus, directed charge separation and transfer are realized through the cooperation of the two components. The recombination of electron-hole pairs is maximumly inhibited, which notably improves the yield of reactive oxygen species by enhancing photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the nanofiber membrane with an optimal doping ratio exhibits outstanding visible light absorption and photothermal conversion performance. Ultimately, photothermal effect and ferroelectric polarization enhanced photocatalysis endow the nanofiber membrane with the ability to kill 99.61% +- 0.28% Staphylococcus aureus and 99.71% +- 0.16% Escherichia coli under 20 min of light irradiation.

In addition, the clinical presentations of certain acute cardiovascular events (such as heart failure) and worsening kidney function overlap and may be challenging to distinguish. Recently, certain novel treatments have demonstrated beneficial effects on both cardiac and kidney outcomes. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have exhibited concordant risk reduction and clinically important benefits in chronic kidney disease with and without diabetes, diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or multiple atherosclerotic vascular disease risk factors, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with and without diabetes. Primary trial results have revealed that sacubitril-valsartan therapy improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and post hoc analyses suggest favorable kidney effects. A concordant pattern of kidney benefit with sacubitril-valsartan has also been observed in chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Given the complex interplay between cardiac and kidney disease and the possibility that treatments may show concordant cardio-kidney benefits, there has been recent interest in formally acknowledging, defining, and using composite cardio-kidney outcomes in future cardiovascular trials.

The expression of decorin mRNA in lens epithelial cells in vitro was found to decrease upon transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-2 addition and increase upon fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 addition. Wound healing of the injured lens in mice transgenic for lens-specific human decorin was promoted by inhibiting myofibroblastic changes. Decorin may be associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and PCO development in the lens.

Therefore, it is important to validate treatment modalities combining molecularly targeted agents with radiotherapy to improve the therapeutic ratio. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of the PARP inhibitor niraparib (MK-4827) alone, or in combination with cell cycle checkpoint abrogating drugs targeting Chk1 (MK-8776) or Wee1 (MK-1775), to radiosensitize HNSCCs in the context of HPV status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PARP1, PARP2, Chk1 or Wee1 shRNA constructs were analyzed from an in vivo shRNA screen of HNSCC xenografts comparing radiosensitization differences between HPV(+) and HPV(-) tumors. Radiosensitization by niraparib alone or in combination with MK-8776 or MK-1775 was assessed by clonogenic survival in HPV(-) and HPV(+) cells; and the role of p16 in determining response was explored. Relative expressions of DNA repair genes were compared by PCR array in HPV(+) and HPV(-) cells, and following siRNA-mediated knockdown of TRIP12 in HPV(-) cells. RESULTS: In vivo shRNA screening showed a modest preferential radiosensitization by Wee1 and PARP2 in HPV(-) and Chk1 in HPV(+) tumor models. Niraparib alone enhanced the radiosensitivity of all HNSCC cell lines tested. However, HPV(-) cells were sensitized to a greater degree, as suggested by the shRNA screen. When combined with MK-8776 or MK-1775, radiosensitization was further enhanced in an HPV dependent manner with HPV(+) cells enhanced by MK-8776 and HPV(-) cells enhanced by MK-1775. A PCR array for DNA repair genes showed PARP and HR proteins BRCA1 and RAD51 were much lower in HPV(+) cells than in HPV(-). Similarly, directly knocking down p16-dependent TRIP12 decreased expression of these same genes. Overexpressing p16 decreased TRIP12 expression and increased radiosensitivity in HPV(-) HN5. However, while PARP inhibition led to significant radiosensitization in the control, it led to no further significant radiosensitization in p16 overexpressing cells. Forced p16 expression in HPV(-) HN5 increased accumulation in G1 and subG1 and limited progression to S phase, thus reducing effectiveness of PARP inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Niraparib effectively radiosensitizes HNSCCs with a greater benefit seen in HPV(-). HPV status also plays a role in response to MK-8776 or MK-1775 when combined with niraparib due to differences in DNA repair mechanisms. This study suggests that using cell cycle abrogators in combination with PARP inhibitors may be a beneficial treatment option in HNSCC, but also emphasizes the importance of HPV status when considering effective treatment strategies.", "pmid": "32073931"}

However, the emergent resistance to multiple sterol-based antifungal drugs emphasizes the need for new therapeutic approaches. The allylamine terbinafine, which selectively inhibits squalene epoxidase Erg1 within the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, is mainly used to treat dermatomycoses, whereas its effectiveness in other fungal infections is limited. Given that ergosterol biosynthesis depends on iron as an essential cofactor, in this report, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate how iron bioavailability influences Erg1 expression and terbinafine susceptibility. We observed that both chemical and genetic depletion of iron decrease ERG1 expression, leading to an increase in terbinafine susceptibility. Deletion of either ROX1 transcriptional repressor or CTH1 and CTH2 post-transcriptional repressors of ERG1 expression led to an increase in Erg1 protein levels and terbinafine resistance. On the contrary, overexpression of CTH2 led to the opposite effect, lowering Erg1 levels and increasing terbinafine susceptibility. Although strain-specific particularities exist, opportunistic pathogenic strains of S. cerevisiae displayed a response similar to the laboratory strain.

Hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas in high concentrations but a beneficial molecule in low concentrations, acts as both a major effector and an important inducer of testosterone. Objective: This study investigated whether a subeffective dose of testosterone combined with a subeffective dose of hydrogen sulfide donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) can be effective in an experimental varicocele model through a possible additive effect. Materials and Methods: Thirty Wistar rats weighing 200-250 gr were divided into 5 groups as (n = 6/each): sham, varicocele, testosterone (200 microg/kg, 5 times per wk for 4 consecutive weeks), NaHS (15 mumol/L, daily for 4 consecutive wk) and testosterone + NaHS (200 microg/kg, 5 times per wk + 15 mumol/L, daily, both for 4 consecutive wk).

Lysosomal protein transmembrane 5 (LAPTM5), a lysosomal membrane protein, plays an important role in several human malignancies. However, the biological functions and mechanism of LAPTM5 in breast cancer remain unclear. In the present study, the potential tumor-promoting effect of LAPTM5 was predicted by bioinformatics analysis. LAPTM5 was highly expressed in breast cancer clinical specimens. Moreover, in vitro studies demonstrated that cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were promoted by LAPTM5 overexpression and were suppressed by LAPTM5 downregulation in vitro. The tumor-promoting effects of LAPTM5 were also confirmed by xenograft tumor assay in vivo. It was found that the tumor-promoting effects of LAPTM5 were partly dependent on the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, dual-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays verified that the transcription factor forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) directly bound to the promoter of LAPTM5 and negatively regulated its expression. Taken together, the present findings indicated that LAPTM5, negatively regulated by FOXP3, promoted the malignant phenotypes of breast cancer through activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.", "pmid": "36799186"}

Anti-VEGF therapy has become the standard treatment for ocular angiogenic disorders in ophthalmological practice. However, there is emerging evidence that anti-VEGF treatment may increase the risk of atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is important for the homeostasis of retinal tissue. Whereas the cytoprotective role of VEGF family molecules, particularly that of VEGF A (VEGFA) through its receptor VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), has been recognized, the physiological role of PlGF in the retina is still unknown. In this study, we explored the role of PlGF in the RPE using PlGF-knockdown RPE cells generated by retrovirus-based PlGF-shRNA transduction. We show that VEGFA reduced apoptosis induced by serum starvation in RPE cells, whereas the antiapoptotic effect of VEGFA was abrogated by VEGFR-2 knockdown. Furthermore, PlGF knockdown increased serum starvation-induced cell apoptosis and unexpectedly reduced the protein level of VEGFR-2 in the RPE. The antiapoptotic effect of VEGFA was also diminished in PlGF-knockdown RPE cells. In addition, we found that glycogen synthase kinase 3 activity was involved in proteasomal degradation of VEGFR-2 in RPE cells and inactivated by PlGF via AKT phosphorylation. Overall, the present data demonstrate that PlGF is crucial for RPE cell viability and that PlGF supports VEGFA/VEGFR-2 signaling by stabilizing the VEGFR-2 protein levels through glycogen synthase kinase 3 inactivation.", "pmid": "35970387"}

In the current study, we observe how HIV-1 Nef upregulates the levels of IL-6, IP-10, and TNF-alpha around 6.0fold in normal human astrocytes (NHAs) compared to cell and empty vector controls. Moderate downregulation in the expression profile of inflammatory cytokines was observed due to RNA interference. Furthermore, we determine the impact of inflammatory cytokines in the upregulation of kynurenine pathway metabolites, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase (HAAO) in NHA, and found the same to be 3.0- and 3.2-fold, respectively. Additionally, the variation in the level of nitric oxide before and after RNA interference was significant. The upregulated cytokines and pathway-specific metabolites could be linked with the neurotoxic potential of HIV-1 Nef. Thus, the downregulation in cytokines and kynurenine metabolites observed after siRNA-Nef interference indicates the possibility of combining the RNA interference approach with current antiretroviral therapy to prevent neurotoxicity development.", "pmid": "36291123"}
{"abstract_id": "1181", "title": "Oncogenic addiction of Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma to the fusion kinase DNAJB1-PRKACA.", "abstract": "PURPOSE: Gene fusions are drivers of many pediatric tumors. In fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC), a fusion of DNAJB1 and PRKACA is the dominant recurrent mutation. Expression of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene in mice results in a tumor that recapitulates FLC. However, it is not known whether transient expression of DNAJB1-PRKACA is sufficient only to trigger tumor formation or whether ongoing expression is necessary for maintenance and progression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We screened shRNAs tiled over the fusion junction and identified several potent and specific candidates in vitro and two independent FLC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). RESULTS: We show that continued DNAJB1-PRKACA expression is not only required for continued tumor growth, but additionally its inhibition results in cell death. Inhibition of DNAJB1-PRKACA by an inducible shRNA in cells of PDX of FLC resulted in cell death in vitro. Induction of the shRNA inhibits FLC tumors growing in mice with no effect on xenografts from a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line engineered to express DNAJB1-PRKACA. CONCLUSION: Our results validate DNAJB1-PRKACA as the oncogene in FLC and demonstrate both a continued requirement for the oncogene for tumor growth as well as an oncogenic addiction that can be exploited for targeted therapies. We anticipate our approach will be useful for investigations of other fusion genes in pediatric cancers and spur development of precision therapies.", "pmid": "36302174"}

In human, slow-twitched fiber gene expression is correlated to MOTS-c, a mitochondria-derived peptide that has been characterized as an exercise mimetic. Within the MOTS-c open reading frame, there is an East Asian-specific m.1382A>C polymorphism (rs111033358) that changes the 14th amino acid of MOTS-c (i.e., K14Q), a variant of MOTS-c that has less biological activity. Here, we examined the influence of the m.1382A>C polymorphism causing MOTS-c K14Q on skeletal muscle fiber composition and physical performance. The myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms (MHC-I, MHC-IIa, and MHC-IIx) as an indicator of muscle fiber composition were assessed in 211 Japanese healthy individuals (102 men and 109 women). Muscular strength was measured in 86 physically active young Japanese men by using an isokinetic dynamometer. The allele frequency of the m.1382A>C polymorphism was assessed in 721 Japanese athletes and 873 ethnicity-matched controls. The m.1382A>C polymorphism genotype was analyzed by TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. Individuals with the C allele of the m.1382A>C exhibited a higher proportion of MHC-IIx, an index of fast-twitched fiber, than the A allele carriers. Men with the C allele of m.1382A>C exhibited significantly higher peak torques of leg flexion and extension. Furthermore, the C allele frequency was higher in the order of sprint/power athletes (6.5%), controls (5.1%), and endurance athletes (2.9%). Additionally, young male mice were injected with the MOTS-c neutralizing antibody once a week for four weeks to mimic the C allele of the m.1382A>C and assessed for protein expression levels of MHC-fast and MHC-slow. Mice injected with MOTS-c neutralizing antibody showed a higher expression of MHC-fast than the control mice. These results suggest that the C allele of the East Asian-specific m.1382A>C polymorphism leads to the MOTS-c K14Q contributes to the sprint/power performance through regulating skeletal muscle fiber composition.", "pmid": "34728329"}

Hence, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data are analyzed to gain detailed insights. Initially, two ceRNA networks with 19 and 3 differentially expressed (DE) hub lncRNAs are reconstructed in SARS-CoV-2 infected Frontal Cortex (FC) and Choroid Plexus (CP), respectively. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses of downstream mRNAs of deregulated ceRNA axes demonstrate impairment of neurological processes. Mapping of hub lncRNA-mRNA pairs from bulk RNA-seq with snRNA-seq data has indicated that NORAD, NEAT1, and STXBP5-AS1 are downregulated across 4, 4, and 2 FC cell types, respectively. At the same time, MIRLET7BHG and MALAT1 are upregulated in excitatory neurons of FC and neurons of CP, respectively. Here, it is hypothesized that downregulation of NORAD, NEAT1, and STXBP5-AS1, and upregulation of MIRLET7BHG and MALAT1 might deregulate respectively 51, 6, and 37, and 31 and 19 mRNAs in cell types of FC and CP.

{"abstract_id": "1184", "title": "A possible mechanism underlying mood disorders associated with LUTS: Chronic bladder outlet obstruction causes NLRP3-dependent inflammation in the hippocampus and depressive behavior in rats.", "abstract": "AIMS: Reports link urinary dysfunction and mood disorders, such as depression, but a causative mechanism has never been postulated. Contemporary discoveries demonstrate a local inflammatory response in peripheral organs can trigger inflammation in the brain, particularly the hippocampus, mediated through the NLRP3 inflammasome. Critically, central inflammation causes depressive behavior. Since bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) evokes a local inflammatory response in the bladder, we hypothesize it will induce NLRP3-dependent inflammation in the hippocampus and depressive behavior. METHODS: There were four groups of rats: control, sham, BOO, or BOO + glyburide (an NLRP3 inhibitor). BOO was created by urethral ligation over a 1 mm catheter. Sham was tied loosely. Glyburide was provided by slow-release pellet (subcutaneous 50 mg, 21 day, replaced as needed). Rats were analyzed 12 weeks post-op for: hippocampal inflammation, microglial density, neurogenesis, and depression symptoms (open field and sucrose preference). RESULTS: BOO elicited hippocampal inflammation, accompanied by an increase in activated microglia (22%) and a decrease in neurogenesis (35%), which was blocked by glyburide. In addition, BOO rats displayed anxiety (57% decrease in exploratory behavior in the open field assay) and anhedonia (21% decrease in sucrose preference), two symptoms of depression. Like inflammation, these symptoms were diminished by glyburide to levels not statistically significantly different from controls. CONCLUSIONS: BOO, a bladder-localized event, stimulates NLRP3-dependent inflammation in the rat hippocampus after 12 weeks and this inflammation causes depressive behavior. This is the first mechanistic explanation of the link between BOO and depression and provides evidence for a distinct bladder-brain axis.", "pmid": "32602164"}

Variance in IGF-1 concentrations due to genetic variations may affect different response to growth hormone (GH) treatment, resulting in different individually required GH-doses in GH-deficient patients. The aim of this study was to test if the IGF-1 gene polymorphisms are associated with the GH-dose of GH-deficient adults. MATERIALS & METHODS: A total of nine tagging SNPs, five additionally selected SNPs and a cytosine-adenine repeat polymorphism were determined in 133 German adult patients (66 men, 67 women; mean age 45.4 years +/- 13.1 standard deviation; majority Caucasian) with GH-deficiency (GHD) of different origin, derived from the prospective Pfizer International Metabolic Study (KIMS) Pharmacogenetics Study. Patients received GH-treatment for 12 months with finished dose-titration of GH and centralized IGF-1 measurements. GH-dose after 1 year of treatment, IGF-1 concentrations, IGF-1-standard deviation score (SDS), the IGF-1:GH ratio and anthropometric data were analyzed by genotype. RESULTS: Except for rs1019731, which showed a significant difference of IGF-1-SDS by genotypes (p = 0.02), all polymorphisms showed no associations with the GH-doses, IGF-1 concentrations, IGF-1-SDS and IGF-1:GH ratio after adjusting for the confounding variables gender, age and BMI. CONCLUSION: IGF-1 gene polymorphisms were not associated with the responsiveness to exogenous GH in GHD. Therefore, genetic variations of the IGF-1 gene seem not to be major influencing factors of the GH-IGF-axis causing variable response to exogenous GH-treatment.", "pmid": "19207031"}

Herein, we have prepared an indocyanine green tagged, genistein encapsulated casein nanoformulation (ICG-Gen@CasNPs) that exhibits the near infra-red region responsive controlled release of genistein and enhanced cellular uptake in the human glioblastoma monolayer and a three-dimensional raft culture model via the enhanced retention effect. ICG-Gen@CasNPs, with the integrated photosensitizer indocyanine green within the nanoformulation, triggered oxidative stress, activating the apoptosis cascade, promoting cell cycle arrest and damaging the mitochondrial membrane potential, collectively directing glioblastoma cell death. The suppression of the polycomb group of proteins in the glioblastoma upon ICG-Gen@CasNPs/NIR exposure revealed the involvement of the epigenetic repression complex machinery in the regulation. Furthermore, ICG-Gen@CasNPs/PDT/PTT directed ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of EZH2 and BMI1 indicates the implication of the polycomb in conferring glioblastoma survival. The increased activation of the apoptotic pathways and the generation of cellular reactive oxygen species upon inhibiting the expression of EZH2 and BMI1 strengthen our observations. It is worth noting that ICG-Gen@CasNPs robustly accumulated in the brain after crossing the blood-brain barrier, which represents the eminent biocompatibility and means that the system is devoid of any nonspecific toxicity in vivo. Moreover, a superior anti-tumor effect was demonstrated on a three-dimensional glioma spheroid model. Thus, this combinatorial chemo/photodynamic therapy revealed that ICG-Gen@CasNPs mediated epigenetic regulation, which is a crucial molecular mechanism of GBM suppression.", "pmid": "36131972"}

Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) is differentially expressed during chondrogenic differentiation and can be produced by MSC. EBI3 is also a subunit of interleukin (IL)-27 and IL-35, and it accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when its partners, such as IL-27 p28 and IL-35 p35, are insufficient. ER stress induced by protein accumulation is responsible for chondrogenic differentiation. However, the role of EBI3 and its relevance to the ER stress in chondrogenic differentiation of MSC have never been addressed. Here, we demonstrate that EBI3 protein is expressed in the early stage of chondrogenic differentiation of MSC. Additionally, knockdown, overexpression, or induction of EBI3 through IL-1beta inhibits chondrogenesis. We show that EBI3 localizes and accumulates in the ER of MSC after overexpression or induction by IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, whereas ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid decreases its accumulation in MSC. Moreover, EBI3 modulates ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1alpha) after induced by IL-1beta, and MSC-like cells coexpress EBI3 and IRE1alpha in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue. Altogether, these data demonstrate that intracellular EBI3 commits to chondrogenic differentiation by regulating ER stress sensor IRE1alpha.", "pmid": "36548354"}

Comparative genomics was performed on host bacterial isolates and isolated phages. Activity of each phage against all 10 host isolates was determined. We also tested phage activity against paired isolates from two patients who developed ceftazidime-avibactam resistance. Results: Bacteria belonged to three Enterobacter species and Klebsiella aerogenes. We isolated 12 bacteriophages, most of which belonged to the Myoviridae and Autographiviridae families. Most phages were able to lyse multiple bacterial isolates, and many lysed isolates of different species.

It has been reported that dehydrocorydaline (DHC) can inhibit monoamine transporter uptake in depressed CUMS mice, but more possible mechanisms of action remain to be further studied. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for five consecutive weeks. The mice were administrated with dehydrocorydaline or fluoxetine (FLU) for four consecutive weeks. Behavioral tests including sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were applied. In parallel, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Nissl staining were used to explore the effect of DHC on pathological changes in the hippocampus. The concentrations of depression-related factors (5-HT and DA) and inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta) in the hippocampus and serum were assessed by ELISA assay. NLRP3 inflammasome pathway-related proteins (NLRP3, IL-18, IL-1 IL-1alpha, and caspase-1) were detected by western blot. The activation of microglia and astrocytes was subjected to immunofluorescent staining. Additionally, microglia were treated with DHC (100 mg/L) for 24 h following incubation with 100 ng/ml LPS for 12 h. ov-NC or ov-NLRP3 plasmid was transfected into microglia 6 h before LPS induction for exploring the effect of NLRP3 overexpression on DHC-inhibited microglia activation. Then, conditioned media of microglia were collected from each group, followed by intervention of astrocytes for 24 h to explore the effect of NLRP3 overexpression of microglia on astrocyte activation. Results: In vivo administration of DHC was found to ameliorate depressive-like behaviors and attenuate neuron damage of CUMS mice. DHC increased neurotransmitter concentration, reduced the proinflammatory factor levels, attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and decreased A1 astrocyte and microglia activation in the hippocampus of CUMS mice. Furthermore, in vivo results showed that activated microglia induced activation of A1 astrocytes but not A2 astrocytes.

Studies have reported that selenium (Se), which is one of the essential trace elements of the poultry and participates in the oxidative metabolism, can alleviate Cr(VI)-induced organ damage by inhibiting oxidative stress, but its specific molecular mechanism remains unclear. Herein, animal models of Cr(VI)- and Se-exposure were constructed using broilers to investigate the antagonistic mechanism of Se to Cr(VI)-induced hepatotoxicity. In this experiment, the four groups of broiler models were used as the research objects: control, Se, Se plus Cr, and Cr groups. Histopathology and ultrastructure liver changes were observed. Liver-somatic index, serum biochemistry, oxidative stress, Nrf2 pathway related factors, and autophagy-related genes were also determined. Overall, Se was found to ameliorate the disorganized structure, hepatic insufficiency, and oxidative damage caused by Cr(VI) exposure. Electron microscopy analysis further showed that the number of autophagosomes was obviously decreased after Se treatment compared to Cr group. Furthermore, gene and protein expression analyses illustrated that the levels of Nrf2, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the Se&Cr group was upregulated, along with decreased expression of Beclin 1, ATG5 and LC3 compared to the Cr group.

Sunitinib and regorafenib are approved in the second- and third-line setting, respectively, with activity against certain secondary mutations with comparatively much lower response rates and survival increment compared to imatinib. All three of these drugs were serendipitously found to have activity in GIST, starting with imatinib, which was formulated for its ability to inhibit BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Ripretinib is a drug that was specifically developed as a more potent KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), with broad-spectrum activity against the mutations encountered in GIST. Encouraging responses in early and later lines of treatment in the Phase 1 trial of ripretinib in GIST led to the rapid development of this novel drug. In a Phase 3 randomized clinical trial with cross-over, ripretinib demonstrated superior PFS and overall survival (OS) in 4th-line treatment and beyond compared to placebo. This established 150 mg once daily ripretinib as the standard of care in this setting. Ripretinib is generally well tolerated, with common adverse effects of hair loss, diarrhea, cramps, fatigue and nausea. The favorable safety profile and efficacy of ripretinib prompted its evaluation in a randomized phase 3 trial in the 2nd-line treatment setting. However, it did not result in a longer PFS duration than sunitinib. Although the efficacy of ripretinib in this unselected patient population was not significantly different from that of sunitinib, the tolerability profile was better.

The (pro)renin receptor (PRR) has recently been demonstrated to play a role in glucose and lipid metabolism. Here, we test the hypothesis that the PRR regulates the development of diet-induced hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. C57Bl/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or normal-fat diet (NFD) with matching calories for 6 weeks. An 8-week methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet was used to induce fibrosis. Two weeks following diet treatment, mice were implanted with a subcutaneous osmotic pump delivering either the peptide PRR antagonist, PRO20, or scrambled peptide for 4 or 6 weeks. Mice fed a 6-week HFD exhibited increased liver lipid accumulation and liver triglyceride content compared with NFD-fed mice. Importantly, PRO20 treatment reduced hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD-fed mice without affecting body weight or blood glucose. Furthermore, PRR antagonism attenuated HFD-induced steatosis, particularly microvesicular steatosis. In the MCD diet model, the percentage of collagen area was reduced in PRO20-treated compared with control mice. PRO20 treatment also significantly decreased levels of liver alanine aminotransferase, an indicator of liver damage, in MCD-fed mice compared with controls. Mechanistically, we found that PRR antagonism prevented HFD-induced increases in PPARgamma and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3 expression in the liver. Taken together, our findings establish the involvement of the PRR in liver triglyceride synthesis and suggest the therapeutic potential of PRR antagonism for the treatment of liver steatosis and fibrosis in NAFLD.", "pmid": "36671527"}

Macrophages also play an important role in wound healing as they drive wound closure by secretion of molecules like transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta). As the functions of macrophages are regulated by their metabolism, local administration of small molecules that alter this might be a novel approach for treatment of wound-healing disorders. Itaconate is a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-derived metabolite that has been associated with resolution of macrophage-mediated inflammation. However, its effects on macrophage wound healing functions are unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of the membrane-permeable 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI) derivative on ECM scavenging by cultured human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM). We found that 4-OI reduced signalling of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced by the canonical immune stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Likely as a consequence of this, the production of the inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 were also reduced. On the transcriptional level, 4-OI increased expression of the gene coding for TGF-beta (TGFB1), whereas expression of the collagenase matrix metalloprotease-8 (MMP8) was reduced. Furthermore, surface levels of the anti-inflammatory marker CD36, but not CD206 and CD11c, were increased in these cells. To directly investigate the effect of 4-OI on scavenging of ECM by macrophages, we developed an assay to measure uptake of fibrous collagen. We observed that LPS promoted collagen uptake and that this was reversed by 4-OI-induced signaling of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), a regulator of cellular resistance to oxidative stress and the reduced glycolytic capacity of the macrophage. These results indicate that 4-OI lowers macrophage inflammation, likely promoting a more wound-resolving phenotype.", "pmid": "36574745"}

The aim of this prospective observational study is to report the effects on pain, mood and QoL of an IT combination therapy delivered by an IDDS-SP in malignant refractory pain. METHODS: Adult patients in which IT therapy was recommended were recruited. An IT therapy with morphine and levobupivacaine was started: VASPI score, depression and anxiety (evaluated by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System -ESAS-), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the 5-level EuroQol 5D version (EQ-5D-5L) and the requirements of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) medications were registered, with adverse events rate and the satisfaction of patients scored as Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). RESULTS: Fifty patients, (16 F/34 M) were enrolled (age 69 +- 12). All had advanced cancer with metastasis. The median daily VASPI score was 75, the median depression score was 6, and the median anxiety score was 4, median PSQI was 16. At 28 days, a significant reduction in VASPI score was registered as well as in depression and anxiety item. Also, PSQI decreased significantly. The EQ-5D-5 L showed a significant improvement in all components at 14 and 28 days. Patient Global Impression of Change scores showed high level of satisfaction. A low incidence of adverse events and a reduction in BTCP episodes were also registered. CONCLUSION: Intrathecal combination therapy delivered by an IDDS-SP could ensure adequate control of cancer related symptoms, such as pain, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances. These effects, with low rate of AEs and reduced BTcP episodes, could explain the improvement in QoL and the overall high levels of patients' satisfaction.", "pmid": "36281899"}

Recently, glucose oxidase (GOx) was reported to be co-delivered with Fenton agent for synergistic starvation therapy (ST) and CDT. However, the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) and hypoxia in tumor microenvironment (TME) restrict the therapeutic efficacy of ST/CDT. Methods and Results: In this work, a novel nanoplatform composed of GOx plus Fenton agent (Cu2+) encapsulated core and metformin (MET)-loaded manganese dioxide nanosheets (MNSs) shell was prepared and further functionalized by arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD). With the RGD-mediated affinity with cancer cells, the nanocomposite (GOx-CuCaP@MNSs-MET@PEG-RGD, GCMMR) could accomplish targeting delivery and TME-activated release of cargos. The intracellular GSH was depleted by MnO2/Cu2+ and abundant H2O2 was generated along with the GOx-induced glucose deprivation, which process was further enhanced by MET-mediated hypoxia relief via inhibiting mitochondria-associated respiration. Subsequently generated  OH from Cu+-mediated Fenton-like reaction exerts severe intracellular oxidative stress and cause apoptosis. Moreover, significant inhibition of tumor growth was detected in a subcutaneous xenograft model of osteosarcoma (OS) after GCMMR treatment. Conclusion: The excellent therapeutic efficacy and biosafety of the nanoplatform were confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, this study provides an appealing strategy with catalytic cascade enhancement on targeted ST/CDT for cancer treatment, especially for hypoxic solid tumors.", "pmid": "36438608"}
{"abstract_id": "1201", "title": "Persistence of cerebellar ataxia during chronic ethanol exposure is associated with epigenetic up-regulation of Fmr1 gene expression in rat cerebellum.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol intoxication produces ataxia by affecting the cerebellum, which coordinates movements. Fragile X mental retardation (FMR) protein is a complex regulator of RNA and synaptic plasticity implicated in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, which features ataxia and increased Fmr1 mRNA expression resulting from epigenetic dysregulation of FMRP. We recently demonstrated that acute ethanol-induced ataxia is associated with increased cerebellar Fmr1 gene expression via histone modifications in rats, but it is unknown whether similar behavioral and molecular changes occur following chronic ethanol exposure. Here, we investigated the effects of chronic ethanol exposure on ataxia and epigenetically regulated changes in Fmr1 expression in the cerebellum. METHODS: Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were trained on the accelerating rotarod and then fed with chronic ethanol or a control Lieber-DeCarli diet while undergoing periodic behavioral testing for ataxia during ethanol exposure and withdrawal. Cerebellar tissues were analyzed for expression of the Fmr1 gene and its targets using a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. The epigenetic regulation of Fmr1 was also investigated using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. RESULTS: Ataxic behavior measured by the accelerating rotarod behavioral test developed during chronic ethanol treatment and persisted at both the 8-h and 24-h withdrawal time points compared to control diet-fed rats. In addition, chronic ethanol treatment resulted in up-regulated expression of Fmr1 mRNA and increased activating epigenetic marks H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation at 2 sites within the Fmr1 promoter. Finally, measurement of the expression of relevant FMRP mRNA targets in the cerebellum showed that chronic ethanol up-regulated cAMP response element binding (CREB) Creb1, Psd95, Grm5, and Grin2b mRNA expression without altering Grin2a, Eaa1, or histone acetyltransferases CREB binding protein (Cbp) or p300 mRNA transcripts. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that epigenetic regulation of Fmr1 and subsequent FMRP regulation of target mRNA transcripts constitute neuroadaptations in the cerebellum that may underlie the persistence of ataxic behavior during chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal.", "pmid": "34453331"}

This study aims to evaluate CDI in lung cancer patients receiving EGFR-TKIs. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using multi-institutional electronic medical records database. We included patients aged older than 20 years diagnosed with lung cancer and treated with EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib). We defined EGFR-TKI initiation date as the index date and occurrence of diarrhea with CDI or without CDI as the event date. We followed patients from the index date until the event date, ICU admission, death, or 12/31/2019. Results: We included 2242 diarrhea patients, 51 were EGFR-TKI with CDI cohort, and 2191 were diarrhea without CDI cohort. Patients who were concurrently taking antibiotics (hazard ratio [HR], 3.30; 95% CI, 1.67-6.5) and systemic steroids (HR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.65-9.06) had an increased risk of CDI. First-generation EGFR-TKIs tended to be associated with an increased risk of CDI compared with afatinib (HR, 1.81, 95% CI, 0.94-3.47). EGFR-TKI with CDI had a higher ICU admission rate (HR, 3.42, 95% CI, 1.98-5.91) and mortality rate (HR, 2.34, 95% CI, 1.67-3.28) than diarrhea without CDI. Conclusion: Patients with CDI had higher ICU admission rates and mortality rates than those without CDI.

Inhibition of ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3) has demonstrated a cardioprotective effect, showing promise for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease treatment, and is currently the focus of ongoing clinical trials. Here, we assessed the genetic basis of variation in ANGPTL3 levels in the San Antonio Family Heart Study. METHODS: We assayed ANGPTL3 protein levels in  1000 Mexican Americans from extended pedigrees. By drawing upon existing plasma lipidome profiles and genomic data we conducted analyses to understand the genetic basis to variation in ANGPTL3 protein levels, and accordingly the correlation with the plasma lipidome. RESULTS: In a variance components framework, we identified that variation in ANGPTL3 was significantly heritable (h2=0.33, P=1.31x10-16). To explore the genetic basis of this heritability, we conducted a genome-wide linkage scan and identified significant linkage (logarithm of odds =6.18) to a locus on chromosome 1 at 90 centimorgans, corresponding to the ANGPTL3 gene location. In the genomes of 23 individuals from a single pedigree, we identified a loss-of-function variant, rs398122988 (N121Kfs*2), in ANGPTL3, that was significantly associated with lower ANGPTL3 levels (beta=-1.69 SD units, P=3.367x10-13), and accounted for the linkage signal at this locus. Given the known role of ANGPTL3 as an inhibitor of endothelial and lipoprotein lipase, we explored the association of ANGPTL3 protein levels and rs398122988 with the plasma lipidome and related phenotypes, identifying novel associations with phosphatidylinositols. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in ANGPTL3 protein levels is heritable and under significant genetic control. Both ANGPTL3 levels and loss-of-function variants in ANGPTL3 have significant associations with the plasma lipidome. These findings further our understanding of ANGPTL3 as a therapeutic target for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.", "pmid": "33887960"}

In Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subgroup medulloblastoma, aberrant activation of SHH signaling causes increased proliferation of granule neuron progenitors (GNPs), and predisposes these cells to tumorigenesis. A second, cooperating genetic hit is often required to push these hyperplastic cells to malignancy and confer mutation-specific characteristics associated with oncogenic signaling. Somatic loss-of-function mutations of the transcriptional corepressor BCOR are recurrent and enriched in SHH medulloblastoma. To investigate BCOR as a putative tumor suppressor, we used a genetically engineered mouse model to delete exons 9/10 of Bcor (Bcor DeltaE9-10 ) in GNPs during development. This mutation leads to reduced expression of C-terminally truncated BCOR (BCORDeltaE9-10). While Bcor DeltaE9-10 alone did not promote tumorigenesis or affect GNP differentiation, Bcor DeltaE9-10 combined with loss of the SHH receptor gene Ptch1 resulted in fully penetrant medulloblastomas. In Ptch1 +/- ;Bcor DeltaE9-10 tumors, the growth factor gene Igf2 was aberrantly up-regulated, and ectopic Igf2 overexpression was sufficient to drive tumorigenesis in Ptch1 +/- GNPs. BCOR directly regulates Igf2, likely through the PRC1.1 complex; the repressive histone mark H2AK119Ub is decreased at the Igf2 promoter in Ptch1 +/- ;Bcor DeltaE9-10 tumors. Overall, our data suggests that BCOR-PRC1.1 disruption leads to Igf2 overexpression, which transforms preneoplastic cells to malignant tumors.", "pmid": "32820036"}

The RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway is one of the several mechanisms that affect bone turnover. The RANKL/OPG ratio has a substantial role in bone resorption. An imbalance between formation and resorption is related to an increased RANKL/OPG balance. OPG, a member of this system, can bind to RANKL and suppress RANK-RANKL interaction, and subsequently, inhibit further osteoclastogenesis. The serum levels of RANKL and OPG in the bone microenvironment are vital for osteoclasts formation. The RANK/RANKL/OPG system plays a role in the pathogenesis of bone disorders. This system can be considered a new treatment target for bone disorders. Soy isoflavones affect the RANK/RANKL/OPG system through numerous mechanisms. Soy isoflavones decrease RANKL levels and increase OPG levels. Therefore, isoflavones improve bone metabolism and decrease bone resorption. Soy isoflavones decrease serum markers of bone resorption and improve bone metabolism. However, while the available data are promising, the results of several studies reported no change in RANKL and OPG levels with isoflavones supplementation. In this regard, current evidence is insufficient for conclusive approval of the efficacy of isoflavones on RANKL/RANK/OPG and further research, including animal and human studies, are needed to confirm the effect of soy isoflavones on the RANKL/RANK/OPG pathway. This study was a review of available evidence to determine the role of isoflavones in bone hemostasis and the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway.

Objective: We explored the early clinical predictive factors of phenoconversion from IRBD to Parkinson's disease (PD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Methods: We assessed baseline office-based cognitive test scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA-J], Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE], and Frontal Assessment Battery [FAB]), motor function, and olfactory function in 36 consecutive polysomnography (PSG)-confirmed IRBD patients with reduced metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) accumulation. PD or DLB was confirmed by medical chart review retrospectively. Results: Of 36 IRBD patients, 19 (n = 19, 52.8%) with abnormal MoCA-J score (< 26) had significantly lower scores in trail making B, phonetic verbal fluency sub-items in the executive domain, and in delayed recall in the memory domain. In total, 12 (33.3%) patients developed PD or DLB; seven of 12 patients (58.3%) developed DLB at a mean follow-up period of 6.8 years. In the normal MoCA-J group (n = 17, 47.2%), two patients developed PD, but none developed dementia. Furthermore, in the abnormal MoCA-J group, seven patients developed DLB and three developed PD without dementia.

Aim: To investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs113420705 of CASP3 in Kawasaki disease (KD) from North India. Settings and Design: Observational, case-control study. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction and bidirectional Sanger sequencing was used for determining genotypes of SNP rs113420705 in 45 cases of KD and 50 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Allele and genotype frequencies were assessed and compared between the groups. Results: Among 45 cases, 32 had TT (71.1%), 13 had CT (28.9%) and none had CC genotype of SNP rs113420705.

Targeting STAT5 has been shown to be a highly effective anti-inflammatory therapy; however, the mechanism by which the STAT5 signaling pathway regulates neuroinflammation following brain injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion remains unclear. Dauricine is an effective agent in anti-inflammation and neuroprotection, but the mechanism by which dauricine acts in ischemia-reperfusion remained unknown. This study is the first to find that the anti-inflammation mechanism of dauricine mainly occurs through the STAT5-NF-kappaB pathway and that it might act as a STAT5 inhibitor. Dauricine suppresses the inflammation caused by cytokines Eotaxin, KC, TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12beta, and IL-17alpha, as well as inhibiting microglia activation. The STAT5b mutant at Tyr-699 reverses the protective effect of dauricine on the oxygen-glucose deprivation-reperfusion injury of neurons and reactivates the P-NF-kappaB expression in microglia. These results suggest that dauricine might be able to suppress the neuroinflammation and protect the neurons from the injury of post-ischemia-reperfusion injury via mediating the microglia activation through the STAT5-NF-kappaB pathway. As a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation, STAT5 needs to be given further attention regarding its role in ischemic stroke.", "pmid": "36138889"}

The synergistic effect of PTX, ETP, and RAPA was evaluated in gastric cancer, and the combination index values were evaluated. Thin-film hydration was used to prepare PTX/ETP/RAPA-loaded mPEG-pH-PCL micelles, and various physicochemical properties of these micelles were evaluated. In vitro cytotoxicity, pH-sensitivity, drug release profiles, in vivo pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution studies of PTX/ETP/RAPA-loaded mPEG-pH-PCL micelles were evaluated. In the pH-sensitivity evaluation, the size of the micelles increased more rapidly at a pH of 5.5 than at a pH of 7.4. The release rate of each drug increased with decreasing pH values in PTX/ETP/RAPA-loaded mPEG-pH-PCL micelles. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that PTX/ETP/RAPA-loaded mPEG-pH-PCL micelles exhibit different drug release behaviors depending on the pH of the tumor and normal tissues and increased bioavailability and circulation time in the blood than solutions.

We hypothesized that E2-induced Ghsr expression augments KNDy sensitivity in a fasting state by elevating ghrelin to disrupt energy expenditure in females. We produced a Kiss1-GHSR knockout to determine the role of GHSR in ARC KNDy neurons. We found that changes in ARC gene expression with estradiol benzoate (EB) treatment were abrogated by the deletion of GHSR and ghrelin abolished these differences. We also observed changes in metabolism and fasting glucose levels. Additionally, knockouts were resistant to body weight gain on a high fat diet (HFD). Behaviorally, we found that knockouts on HFD exhibited reduced anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, knockouts did not refeed to the same extent as controls after a 24 h fast.

Glucocorticoids can promote steatosis by stimulating lipolysis within adipose tissue, free fatty acid delivery to liver and hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Glucocorticoids can be reactivated in liver through 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b-HSD1) enzyme activity. Inhibition of 11b-HSD1 has been suggested as a potential treatment for NAFLD. To test this, male mice with global (11b-HSD1 knockout [KO]) and liver-specific (LKO) 11b-HSD1 loss of function were fed the American Lifestyle Induced Obesity Syndrome (ALIOS) diet, known to recapitulate the spectrum of NAFLD, and metabolic and liver phenotypes assessed. Body weight, muscle and adipose tissue masses, and parameters of glucose homeostasis showed that 11b-HSD1KO and LKO mice were not protected from systemic metabolic disease. Evaluation of hepatic histology, triglyceride content, and blinded NAFLD activity score assessment indicated that levels of steatosis were similar between 11b-HSD1KO, LKO, and control mice. Unexpectedly, histological analysis revealed significantly increased levels of immune foci present in livers of 11b-HSD1KO but not LKO or control mice, suggestive of a transition to NASH. This was endorsed by elevated hepatic expression of key immune cell and inflammatory markers. These data indicate that 11b-HSD1-deficient mice are not protected from metabolic disease or hepatosteatosis in the face of a NAFLD-inducing diet.

Additionally, mice were pretreated with visfatin and further administered LPS to observe the effects of visfatin on cardiac injury. Finally, septic mice were also pretreated with JSH-23 to investigate whether visfatin regulates cardiac injury via the NF-kappaB p65 pathway.

Therapy resistance is often based on apoptosis deficiency, and may depend on antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w and Mcl-1. For their targeting, several antagonists have been generated, which mimic the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3 mimetics). As dysregulation and overexpression of Mcl-1 has been reported in CTCL, the use of Mcl-1 inhibitors appears as an attractive strategy. Here, we investigated the effects of the selective Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 in a series of four CTCL cell lines, in comparison to ABT-263 and ABT-737 (inhibitors of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w). In two cell lines (HH, HuT-78), S63845 resulted in significant apoptosis induction, decrease in cell viability, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase activation, while two other cell lines (MyLa, SeAx) remained completely resistant. An inverse correlation was found, as S63845-resistant cells were highly sensitive to ABT-263/-737, and S63845-sensitive cells showed only moderate sensitivity to ABTs. Combinations of S63845 and ABT-263 partially yielded synergistic effects. As concerning Bcl-2 protein expression, weaker Mcl-1 expression was found in S63845-resistant MyLa and SeAx, while for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, the lowest expression was found in the highly sensitive cell line HH.

A total of 161 CHC patients were clinically, histologically, and biochemically evaluated. Genotyping was performed by melting-curve analysis and statistical analysis by SPSS 24.0. There were significant differences between ABCA1_rs2230808 genotypes and total cholesterol, gammaGT (gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase), and HCV-RNA. Gender differences: in females, ABCA1_rs2230808 (GG or GA) was associated with higher HCV-RNA serum levels; in males, ABCA1_rs2230808 (GG or GA) was associated with higher gammaGT, lower total cholesterol, increased risk for gammaGT >= 38 UI/L, and total cholesterol < 4.92 mmol/L. Only in the case of males were higher gammaGT and lower total cholesterol associated with severe fibrosis and steatosis. Total cholesterol < 4.92 mmol/L also associates with severe necroinflammation. We conclude that ABCA1_rs2230808 is gender-specific. ABCA1_rs2230808 Allele G was associated with different clinical and biochemical parameters, which are related to more severe liver disease.", "pmid": "36421770"}

Studies have shown an increased expression of REG3A in systemic inflammatory responses to acute injury and infection, but studies investigating REG3A during the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke are limited. The aims of this study were to examine the associations between arterial expression of REG3A and other arterial inflammatory proteins implicated in stroke pathogenesis, as well as associations between REG3A and markers of poor outcome for ischemic stroke. The University of Kentucky Blood and Clot Thrombectomy Registry and Collaboration (BACTRAC) protocol (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03153683) utilizes thrombectomy to isolate intracranial arterial blood (i.e. distal to thrombus) and systemic arterial blood (i.e. carotid). Samples were analyzed by Olink Proteomics for N = 42 subjects. Statistical analyses of plasma proteins included 2-sample t-tests, spearman and biserial correlations, and robust regression models to elucidate network signaling and association to clinical outcomes. Results indicated that levels of systemic REG3A were positively correlated with inflammatory proteins interleukin IL6 (R = 0.344, p = 0.030) and IL17C (R = 0.468, p = 0.002). 2-sided t- tests examining differences of systemic REG3A within quartiles of NIHSS admission score depicted significant differences between quartiles. Those with NIHSS scores corresponding to moderate and moderate-severe neurofunctional deficits had significantly higher levels of systemic REG3A compared to those with NIHSS scores corresponding to mild and mild-moderate neurofunctional deficits (p = 0.016). STRING analyses of proteins in each robust regression model demonstrated substantial networking between REG3A and other systemic proteins highly relevant to ischemic stroke. The present study provides novel data on systemic REG3A in the context of ischemic stroke. These results demonstrate the influential role of REG3A regarding surrogate functional and radiographic outcomes of stroke severity. Additionally, they provide novel insight into the role of REG3A and related proteins during the complex neuroinflammatory process of ischemic stroke. These data provide a foundation for future studies to investigate REG3A and related networking proteins as potential biomarkers with prognostic potential, as well as potential therapeutic targets.", "pmid": "34558059"}
{"abstract_id": "1218", "title": "Myoclonus status revealing COVID 19 infection.", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: At the beginning of the coronavirus virus (COVID-19) pandemic, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) was thought to cause mainly respiratory symptoms, largely sparing the brain and the rest of the nervous system. However, as the knowledge about COVID-19 infection progresses and the number of COVID19-related neurological manifestations reports increases, neurotropism and neuroinvasion were finally recognized as major features of the SARS-CoV-2. Neurological manifestations involving the central nervous system are sparse, ranging from headaches, drowsiness, and neurovascular attacks to seizures and encephalitis [1]. Thus far, several cases of non-epileptic myoclonus were reported in critical patients [2,3]. Here, we report the first case of myoclonus status as the inaugural and sole symptom of COVID-19 in a conscious patient. OBSERVATION: A 60-year-old man with unknown family history and no medical issues other than smoking one cigarette packet a day over the span of 25 years. The patient presented with 5 days of abnormal movements in bilateral arms following the COVID vaccination. They were described as brief, involuntary jerking, like in sleep starts, in the proximal part of their upper members, and his face with a regular tremor in his arms exacerbated by movements and emotion. His movement disorder worsened the second day, and he developed an abnormal gait with slurred speech, concomitantly with diarrhea. Seven days following the symptoms onset, the patient was alert. His neurological exam revealed multifocal myoclonic jerks affecting four limbs predominantly proximal, the face, and the trunk (video 1). The myoclonic jerks were sensitive to tactile and auditory stimuli, without enhanced startle response or hyperekplexia. His gait was unsteady due to severe myoclonus, without cerebellar ataxia (video 2) and he had mild dysarthria. No dysmetria at the finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests were found. Examination of eye movements revealed paralysis of Down-Gaze and no opsoclonus was detected. Physical exam was unremarkable, including lack of fever and meningitis signs. The electroencephalogram (EEG) did not show any abnormalities concomitant with myoclonic jerks (Fig.1). The cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was normal (Fig. 2). An extensive biological work-up including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an arterial blood gas analysis, a urine drug screen, a thyroid function test, a vitamin B12, folate, and ammonia level, and HIV and syphilis serologies were inconclusive. Testing for autoimmune and paraneoplastic antineuronal antibodies including anti-NMDA-R was negative. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study was unremarkable (0.3 g/l of proteinorachia, 1 white blood cell). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and SARS-CoV-2 in CSF was negative. However, the patient tested positive for COVID-19 through PCR for viral RNA from the nasopharyngeal swab. After the administration of 12mg/day of Dexamethasone for 3 days, along with clonazepam and levetiracetam, the patient's symptoms started improving on day 3 and he displayed a very slow but progressive recovery. DISCUSSION: Our patient presented with acute isolated multifocal myoclonus status without cognitive impairment. These movements were prominent, spontaneous, worsened by action, and sensitive to touch and sound. The anatomical source of this myoclonus could be cortical or subcortical despite the absence of evident EEG discharges. Several diseases can cause acute myoclonus such as severe hypoxia, metabolic disturbances, and paraneoplastic syndromes. these diagnoses were ruled out in our patient. Post-vaccinal origin was also suggested, but its accountability was not proven. Thus, the two hypothetic etiologies raised were either para-infectious or infectious mechanisms in relation to SARS-Cov 2 infection. HIV, VZV, HSV, and syphilis infections were eliminated and the patient tested positive for SARS-Cov2 infection. In the literature, COVID-19-related myoclonus was reported as a complication of an already-known SARS-CoV-2 infection in about 50 patients so far. It generally occurs between 6 days and 26 days following the SARS-CoV-2 infection [2-5], and affects critical illness patients with cognitive decline, mainly from the intensive care unit [3,4]. Yet, our patient did not display any symptoms of COVID-19 infection before the occurrence of these abnormal movements. Furthermore, he had a relatively good general condition and no cognitive impairment. Several pathophysiological mechanisms were suggested regarding the COVID-19-related myoclonus. Either central nervous invasion by SARS-Cov 2 after transneuronal spread and/or auto-immune cross-reactivity reaction, are likely incriminated in the pathophysiology of most of the cases [6]. We believe that there is an inflammatory process involved with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and systemic inflammation, including cytokine storm or cytokine release syndrome targeting the brain and more specifically the cortex and basal ganglia [6]. Data collection in clinical registries is needed to increase our knowledge of the prevalence of neurological symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and will hopefully clarify the causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and post-COVID-19 myoclonic syndrome.", "pmid": "36446232"}
{"abstract_id": "1219", "title": "Human DDX6 effects miRNA-mediated gene silencing via direct binding to CNOT1.", "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in a variety of biological processes through widespread effects on protein synthesis. Upon association with the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), miRNAs repress target mRNA translation and accelerate mRNA decay. Degradation of the mRNA is initiated by shortening of the poly(A) tail by the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex followed by the removal of the 5' cap structure and exonucleolytic decay of the mRNA. Here, we report a direct interaction between the large scaffolding subunit of CCR4-NOT, CNOT1, with the translational repressor and decapping activator protein, DDX6. DDX6 binds to a conserved CNOT1 subdomain in a manner resembling the interaction of the translation initiation factor eIF4A with eIF4G. Importantly, mutations that disrupt the DDX6-CNOT1 interaction impair miRISC-mediated gene silencing in human cells. Thus, CNOT1 facilitates recruitment of DDX6 to miRNA-targeted mRNAs, placing DDX6 as a downstream effector in the miRNA silencing pathway.", "pmid": "25035296"}

FMRP has been shown to bind to a G-rich region within the PSD-95 mRNA which encodes for the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), and together with the microRNA miR-125a, to play an important role in the reversible inhibition of the PSD-95 mRNA translation in neurons. The loss of FMRP in Fmr1 KO mice disables this translation control in the production of the PSD-95 protein. Interestingly, the miR-125a binding site on PSD-95 mRNA is embedded in the G-rich region bound by FMRP and postulated to adopt one or more G quadruplex structures. In this study, we have used different biophysical techniques to validate and characterize the formation of parallel G quadruplex structures and binding of miR-125a to its complementary sequence located within the 3' UTR of PSD-95 mRNA. Our results indicate that the PSD-95 mRNA G-rich region folds into alternate G quadruplex conformations that coexist in equilibrium. miR-125a forms a stable complex with PSD-95 mRNA, as evident by characteristic Watson-Crick base-pairing that coexists with one of the G quadruplex forms, suggesting a novel mechanism for G quadruplex structures to regulate the access of miR-125a to its binding site.", "pmid": "25406362"}

Uncertain phenotypes and extended range of intra- and interfamilial heterogenicity make still difficult to determine a precise genotype-phenotype correlation. Here, we used a next-generation sequencing approach to study a Sicilian family with a suspected form of CORD. Affected family members underwent ophthalmological examinations and a proband, blind from 50 years, underwent whole genome and exome sequencing. Variant analysis was enriched by pathway analysis and relevant variants were, then, investigated in other family members and in 100 healthy controls from Messina. CORD diagnosis with an intricate pattern of symptoms was confirmed by ophthalmological examinations. A total of about 50,000 variants were identified in both proband's genome and exome. All affected family members presented specific genotypes mainly determined by mutated GUCY2D gene, and different phenotypical traits, mainly related to focus and color perception. Thus, we looked for possible modifier genes. According to relationship with GUCY2D, predicted functional effects, eye localization, and ocular disease affinity, only 9 variants, carried by 6 genes (CACNG8, PAX2, RXRG, CCDC175, PDE4DIP and LTF), survived the filtering. These genes encode key proteins involved in cone development and survival, and retina neurotransmission. Among analyzed variants, CACNG8c.*6819A>T and the new CCDC175 c.76C>T showed extremely low frequency in the control group, suggesting a key role on disease phenotypes. Such discovery could enforce the role of modifier genes into CORD onset/progression, contributing to improve diagnostic test towards a better personalized medicine.", "pmid": "36490268"}

OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ECG, for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using Tc99m-Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia. METHODS: The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi-SPECT/dobutamine stress test. Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level. In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT. The increase in dP/dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group. dP/dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone. RESULTS: The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%. CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost-savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, especially in patients unable to exercise.", "pmid": "17491223"}

Here, we found that acrolein, an aldehyde that is significantly elevated in Parkinson's disease patient serum, enhances autophagy by promoting lysosomal clustering around the microtubule organising centre via a newly identified JIP4-TRPML1-ALG2 pathway. Phosphorylation of JIP4 at T217 by CaMK2G in response to Ca2+ fluxes tightly regulated this system. Increased vulnerability of JIP4 KO cells to acrolein indicated that lysosomal clustering and subsequent autophagy activation served as defence mechanisms against cytotoxicity of acrolein itself. Furthermore, the JIP4-TRPML1-ALG2 pathway was also activated by H2 O2 , indicating that this system acts as a broad mechanism of the oxidative stress response. Conversely, starvation-induced lysosomal retrograde transport involved both the TMEM55B-JIP4 and TRPML1-ALG2 pathways in the absence of the JIP4 phosphorylation. Therefore, the phosphorylation status of JIP4 acts as a switch that controls the signalling pathways of lysosoma l distribution depending on the type of autophagy-inducing signal.", "pmid": "36394115"}

The experiment was set up with four treatments: foliar spraying of distilled water (CK), 50 mmol.L-1 NaCl (NaCl), 50 mmol.L-1 NaCl+foliar spray of 0.02 mumol.L-1 EBR (EBR+NaCl), and 50 mmol.L-1 NaCl+foliar spray of 24 mumol.L-1 Brassinazole (BRZ) (BRZ+NaCl). The results showed that EBR+NaCl treatment significantly increased plant height, above-ground fresh weight, total root length, total root surface area, average rhizome and photosynthetic pigment content compared to NaCl treatment. Meanwhile, compared with NaCl treatment, EBR+NaCl treatment significantly increased superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase (SOD, CAT and APX) activities, significantly promoted the accumulation of osmoregulatory substances (soluble sugars and proline), and thus effectively reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content and relative electrical conductivity of cucumber leaves. Exogenous spraying of EBR also significantly reduced Na+/K+ under NaCl stress, effectively alleviating the toxic effects of Na+ ions. In addition, exogenous EBR induced the up-regulated expression of CsMAPK3, CsMAPK4, CsMAPK6 and CsMAPK9 genes in the MAPK cascade signaling pathway and CsSOS1, CsSOS2 and CsSOS3 genes in the SOS signaling pathway to enhance salt tolerance in cucumber under NaCl stress. Therefore, exogenous spraying EBR may effectively reduce the damage of salt stress on cucumber seedlings by improving antioxidant capacity, maintaining ion homeostasis and activating salt-tolerant related signaling pathways, which might promote the growth of cucumber seedlings and the establishment of root system morphology. This study provides a reference for EBR to improve the salt tolerance of cucumber.", "pmid": "36438149"}

METHODS: This study included 488 patients diagnosed with PTC by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy, collected clinicopathological data, analyzed the correlation between CLNM and clinicopathological features using univariate analysis and binary logistic regression, and constructed prediction models. RESULTS: Binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, maximum diameter of thyroid nodules, capsular invasion, and BRAF V600E gene mutation were independent risk factors for CLNM, and statistically significant indicators were included to construct a nomogram prediction model, which had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.778. A convolutional neural network (CNN) prediction model built with an artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning algorithm achieved AUCs of 0.89 in the training set and 0.78 in the test set, which indicated a high prediction efficacy for CLNM. In addition, the prediction models were validated in the subclinical metastasis and clinical metastasis groups with high sensitivity and specificity, suggesting the broad applicability of the models. Furthermore, CNN prediction models were constructed for patients with nodule diameters less than 1 cm.

It has been proved that LXD has been shown to have a significant inhibitory effect on suppresses the inflammatory cells associated with uveitis. However, the key functional combination of component groups and their possible mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: The community detecting model of the network, the functional response space, and reverse prediction model were utilized to decode the key components group (KCG) and possible mechanism of LXD in treating uveitis. Finally, MTT assay, NO assay and ELISA assay were applied to verify the effectiveness of KCG and the accuracy of our strategy. Results: In the components-targets-pathogenic genes-disease (CTP) network, a combination of Huffman coding and random walk algorithm was used and eight foundational acting communities (FACs) were discovered with important functional significance. Verification has shown that FACs can represent the corresponding C-T network for treating uveitis. A novel node importance calculation method was designed to construct the functional response space and pick out 349 effective proteins. A total of 54 components were screened and defined as KCG. The pathway enrichment results showed that KCG and their targets enriched signal pathways of IL-17, Toll-like receptor, and T cell receptor played an important role in the pathogenesis of uveitis. Furthermore, experimental verification results showed that important KCG quercetin and sitosterol markedly inhibited the production of nitric oxide and significantly regulated the level of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in Lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 cells.

Blocking DNA damage repair can increase the radiosensitivity of tumor cells. Recent studies have identified long noncoding RNAs as key regulators in DNA damage repair. The lncRNA ANRIL was previously shown to be involved in homologous recombination (HR) repair, but its specific mechanism has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: The downstream interacting miRNAs of ANRIL were predicted according to miRanda software. Fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression levels of ANRIL and candidate miRNAs. Clone formation experiment and cell viability assays detect cell viability after ionizing radiation. Apoptosis assay was used to detect the apoptosis of cells after 8 h of ionizing radiation. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assays verified the protein expression levels of the downstream target molecule PARP1 of miR-7-5p and key molecules in the HR pathway. Fluorescent reporter gene experiments were used to verify the interaction between ANRIL and miR-7-5p and between miR-7-5p and PARP1. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis and qPCR validation suggested that miR-7-5p might be a downstream molecule of ANRIL. The expression of miR-7-5p was up-regulated after knockdown of ANRIL, and the expression of miR-7-5p was down-regulated after overexpression of ANRIL. Meanwhile, there was a negative correlation between ANRIL and miR-7-5p expression changes before and after ionizing radiation. The luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed the existence of ANRIL binding site with miR-7-5p, and found that transfection of miR-7-5p inhibitor can reduce the radiation sensitivity of ANRIL-KD cells. A downstream target molecule of miR-7-5p related to HR repair, PARP1, was screened through website prediction. Subsequently, it was confirmed by Western blot and luciferase reporter assays that miR-7-5p could down-regulate the expression of PARP1, and there was a miR-7-5p binding site on the 3'UTR of PARP1 mRNA. This suggests that ANRIL may act as a competitive endogenous RNA to bind miR-7-5p and upregulate the expression of PARP1. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect the expression changes of HR repair factors in ANRIL-KD cells after ionizing radiation, and it was found that knockdown of ANRIL can inhibit the expression of PARP1, BRCA1 and Rad51, hinder radiation-induced HR repair, and eventually result in resensitizing ANRIL-KD cells to ionizing radiation.

Targeting these mechanisms therapeutically may be important in managing cancer progression. Here, we identify the ELF3 transcription factor as the canonical mediator of IL-1alpha-induced differentiation of prostate mesenchymal stem cells to an iCAF phenotype, typical of the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, IL-1alpha-induced iCAFs were subsequently refractive to TGF-beta1 induced trans-differentiation to a myofibroblast phenotype (myCAF), another key carcinoma-associated fibroblast subtype typical of reactive stroma in cancer. Restricted trans-differentiation was associated with phosphorylation of the YAP protein, indicating that interplay between ELF3 action and activation of the Hippo pathway are critical for restricting trans-differentiation of iCAFs.

Thrombin, via its cognate GPCR, protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1, transactivates tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase receptors, specifically the epidermal growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor-beta receptor, respectively. PAR-1 transactivation-dependent signalling leads to the modification of lipid-binding proteoglycans involved in the retention of lipids and the development of atherosclerosis. The mechanisms of GPCR transactivation of kinase receptors are distinct. We aimed to investigate the role of proximal G proteins in transactivation-dependent signalling. MAIN METHODS: Using pharmacological and molecular approaches, we studied the role of the G  subunits, G q and G 11, in the context of PAR-1 transactivation-dependent signalling leading to proteoglycan modifications. KEY FINDINGS: Pan G q subunit inhibitor UBO-QIC/FR900359 inhibited PAR-1 transactivation of kinase receptors and proteoglycans modification. The G q/11 inhibitor YM254890 did not affect PAR-1 transactivation pathways. Molecular approaches revealed that of the two highly homogenous G q members, G q and G 11, only the G q was involved in regulating PAR-1 mediated proteoglycan modification. Although G q and G 11 share approximately 90% homology at the protein level, we show that the two isoforms exhibit different functional roles.

It is central to lung cancer, the leading cancer in terms of associated mortality that has affected millions of individuals worldwide. Inflammation and pulmonary manifestations are also the major causes of COVID-19 related deaths. Acute hyperinflammation plays an important role in the COVID-19 disease progression and severity, and development of protective immunity against the virus is greatly sought. Further, the severity of COVID-19 is greatly enhanced in lung cancer patients, probably due to the genes such as ACE2, TMPRSS2, PAI-1 and furin that are commonly involved in cancer progression as well as SAR-CoV-2 infection. The importance of inflammation in pulmonary manifestations, cancer and COVID-19 calls for a closer look at the underlying processes, particularly the associated increase in IL-6 and other cytokines, the dysregulation of immune cells and the coagulation pathway. Towards this end, several reports have identified epigenetic regulation of inflammation at different levels. Expression of several key inflammation-related cytokines, chemokines and other genes is affected by methylation and acetylation while non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs as well as long non-coding RNAs, also affect the overall inflammatory responses. Select miRNAs can regulate inflammation in COVID-19 infection, lung cancer as well as other inflammatory lung diseases, and can serve as epigenetic links that can be therapeutically targeted. Furthermore, epigenetic changes also mediate the environmental factors-induced inflammation. Therefore, a better understanding of epigenetic regulation of inflammation can potentially help develop novel strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat chronic pulmonary diseases, lung cancer and COVID-19.", "pmid": "33484868"}

The objective of the current study was to investigate the synergistic anticarcinogenic effects of RLIP inhibition/depletion and 2HF in an in vivo model of DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis in SENCAR mice. Mice were given 2HF (50 mg/kg, bw, orally on alternate days), RLIP antibody (Rab; 5 mg/kg, bw, ip weekly), RLIP antisense (RAS; 5 mg/kg, b.w., ip weekly), or a combination of 2HF + Rab + RAS. Animals were monitored daily, and 7 days after the first appearance of moribund behavior, tissues were harvested for morphological and immunohistological analysis. Western blot analyses were performed to determine the expression of anti- and proapoptotic proteins in the mammary glands. Our results reveal that 2HF, RAS, and Rab significantly prevented the carcinogenic effects of DMBA administration in the mammary glands and other organs. Further, mice treated with a combination of 2HF + RAS + Rab exhibited no carcinogenic effect of DMBA as compared to either or the single agent-treated mice. This study demonstrates for the first time the anticarcinogenic effects of 2HF and RLIP inhibition/depletion in vivo in a novel DMBA-induced model of BC in SENCAR mice and provides the rationale for further clinical investigation.", "pmid": "31006917"}
{"abstract_id": "1234", "title": "Crystal structure of the Ate1 arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase and arginylation of N-degron substrates.", "abstract": "N-degron pathways are proteolytic systems that target proteins bearing N-terminal (Nt) degradation signals (degrons) called N-degrons. Nt-Arg of a protein is among Nt-residues that can be recognized as destabilizing ones by the Arg/N-degron pathway. A proteolytic cleavage of a protein can generate Arg at the N terminus of a resulting C-terminal (Ct) fragment either directly or after Nt-arginylation of that Ct-fragment by the Ate1 arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase (R-transferase), which uses Arg-tRNAArg as a cosubstrate. Ate1 can Nt-arginylate Nt-Asp, Nt-Glu, and oxidized Nt-Cys* (Cys-sulfinate or Cys-sulfonate) of proteins or short peptides. Ate1 genes of fungi, animals, and plants have been cloned decades ago, but a three-dimensional structure of Ate1 remained unknown. A detailed mechanism of arginylation is unknown as well. We describe here the crystal structure of the Ate1 R-transferase from the budding yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. The 58-kDa R-transferase comprises two domains that recognize, together, an acidic Nt-residue of an acceptor substrate, the Arg residue of Arg-tRNAArg, and a 3'-proximal segment of the tRNAArg moiety. The enzyme's active site is located, at least in part, between the two domains. In vitro and in vivo arginylation assays with site-directed Ate1 mutants that were suggested by structural results yielded inferences about specific binding sites of Ate1. We also analyzed the inhibition of Nt-arginylation activity of Ate1 by hemin (Fe3+-heme), and found that hemin induced the previously undescribed disulfide-mediated oligomerization of Ate1. Together, these results advance the understanding of R-transferase and the Arg/N-degron pathway.", "pmid": "35878037"}

The concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after MA administration, which was inhibited by the alpha-TC and DFO pretreatment. alpha-TC and DFO attenuated the MA-induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity. The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced glutathione concentration was lower in the MA-treated rats. These changes were significantly attenuated by alpha-TC and DFO.

The aim of this study was to determine whether genetic variations in the interleukin 10 (IL10) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (Anti-CCP) antibody loci were linked to RA. Methods: In this hospital-based case-control study with 224 cases and 194 healthy individuals, we investigated the association of IL-10 genotypes and anti-CCP antibodies with RA. Independent sample t, chi-square, and Fisher exact tests were used to assess the association between study variables. Results: Frequency of IL-10 -1082 A/G genotype in RA patients is significantly higher than the control group (odds ratio [OR], 1.67 [95% CI, 1.11-2.51]) (p=0.009), while the frequency of IL-10-1082 A/A and G/G polymorphisms in RA patients was lower than controls and this finding for G/G polymorphism was statistically significant (p=0.01). No significant difference was observed between the 2 studied groups regarding IL-10-592 C/C, C/A, and A/A polymorphisms (p>0.05). The chance of RA occurrence among persons with positive anti-CCP was significantly (63.3 times [22.7-176.5]) higher than individuals with negative anti-CCP (p<0.001). Conclusion: According to our data, the chance of anti-CCP positivity in persons who have IL-10 genotype 1082 A/G is higher. Further studies are recommended to determine the relationship between IL-10 genotype 1082 G/A and RA.

Nevertheless, the credibility of the evidence for this practice is unclear. Therefore, we intended to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies to assess the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of APS when used in the treatment of UC. Methods: Electronic bibliographic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM), Wanfang Database, CQVIP Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were retrieved for relevant animal studies. The methodological quality of animal studies was evaluated based on the SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE's RoB tool). A meta-analysis was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions by using STATA 12.0 software. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42021272595. Results: Twenty qualified publications involving 591 animals were included in this study. There was a significant association of APS with levels of disease activity index (DAI), colon macroscopic damage index (CMDI), colon histopathologic score (CHS), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) compared with that in the control group. Sensitivity analysis that eliminated one study at each stage did not change these results. Egger's test and funnel plot showed that publication bias was existed. Conclusion: In this meta-analysis, APS treatment significantly mitigated colonic damage by reducing the levels of MPO, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and MDA and recovering the SOD activity. These results demonstrated a protective role of APS in the treatment of UC and showed that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity were implicated in the underlying mechanisms. Hence, APS may represent a promising candidate for treating UC. However, due to potential publication bias, a cautious interpretation is needed.

However, so far, it is lack of evidence to support this proposition. The main aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that lithium bidirectionally regulates depression- and mania-related brain functional abnormalities in patients with BP. We also assessed the effects of lithium, alone and in combination with other pharmacological treatments, on patients' cognitive performance. We enrolled 149 drug-naive patients with BP; 99 patients experiencing first depressive episodes were allocated randomly to four treatment groups [lithium (DP/Li), lithium with lamotrigine (LTG; DP/Li+LTG), LTG (DP/LTG), and valproate (VPA) with LTG (DP/VPA+LTG)], and 50 experiencing first hypo-manic episodes were allocated to two treatment groups (MA/Li and MA/VPA). For comparative analysis, 60 age-matched healthy individuals were also recruited. Whole-brain global and regional resting-state cerebral blood flow (rs-CBF) and cognitive alterations were examined before and after 12-week treatment. We have the following findings: DP/Li+LTG, and to a lesser extent DP/Li, alleviated the depression-related reduction in rs-CBF. MA/VPA and MA/Li reversed the mania-related elevation of rs-CBF completely and partially, respectively. Lithium alone improved cognitive performance during depressive and manic episodes; other tested treatments have no such effect or worsened cognitive ability. Our results showed that lithium bidirectionally regulates depression- and mania-associated brain functional abnormalities in patients with BP.

Cigarette carcinogens have the capacity to alter early response gene expression in tobacco-related malignancies via genes such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB). A number of early response gene activation events are also facilitated by fos/jun activator protein 1 (AP-1) associated pathways. In the present study, we hypothesize that tobacco products may induce microenvironment alterations, promoting angiogenesis and providing a permissive environment for head and neck cancer progression. In an in vitro analysis, we employed immortalized oral keratinocyte (HOK-16B) and laryngeal squamous carcinoma (UM-SCC-11A) cells to investigate interleukin (IL)-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induction by cigarette smoke condensate (CSC). IL-8 and VEGF expression is based on interactions between NFkappaB, AP-1, and NF-IL6. We identified at least 1.5-fold dose-dependent induction of AP-1, VEGF, and IL-8 promoter/reporter gene activity after 24 h exposure to CSC. Next, we stably transfected UM-SCC-11A cells with A-Fos, a dominant negative AP-1 protein. Treatment with CSC of the A-Fos cell lines compared to empty vector controls significantly down-regulated AP-1, VEGF, and IL-8 promoter/reporter gene expression. We also performed ELISAs and discovered significant up-regulation of IL-8 and VEGF secretion by UMSCC 11A after treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and CSC, which was down-regulated by the A-Fos dominant negative protein. We conclude tobacco carcinogens up-regulate AP-1 activity and AP-1 dependent IL-8 and VEGF gene expression in head and neck cancer. This up-regulation may promote an angiogenic phenotype favoring invasion in both premalignant and squamous cancer cells of the head and neck.", "pmid": "21480395"}

The results showed that grain yield increased with increasing K under the same N level, and top-dressing K further increased the grain yield. K application increased starch content significantly at N180 and decreased significantly at N225, while the protein content increased significantly at the two N levels.

Application of K increased the retrogradation enthalpy (DeltaHret) and retrogradation percentage (%R) at N180. At N225, the DeltaHret and %R of K75 and K150 decreased, while those of K75 + 75 increased. The DeltaHret and %R under K75 + 75 at N180 were lower than N225. Under these experiment conditions, 75 kg ha-1 K2O at sowing date and top-dressed 75 kg ha-1 K2O at jointing stage (V6) under the conditions of appropriate N reduction could not only effectively improve the pasting and thermal properties of waxy maize flour, but also stabilized the grain yield.", "pmid": "36235394"}

We aimed to evaluate HRAS mutational variants, comutation profile, and survival outcomes of this molecularly defined population. METHODS: We leveraged four deidentified patient data sets with HRAS-mutant HNSCC, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Kura Oncology, Inc trial, Foundation Medicine, and American Association for Cancer Research GENIE v.12. Patient demographic information and clinical courses were extracted, when available, in addition to HRAS mutation type and co-occurring mutations. Survival outcomes were analyzed (Kaplan-Meier method). RESULTS: Two hundred forty-nine patients with HRAS-mutant HNSCC were identified from the four data sets. Median age ranged from 55 to 65 years, with a higher frequency in male patients (64%); the majority of HRAS-mutant HNSCC occurred in human papillomavirus-negative HNSCC. HRAS mutation patterns were similar across data sets; G12S was the most common (29%). Treatment responses to tipifarnib were not codon-specific. Compared with wild-type, significantly co-occurring mutations with HRAS were Casp8 (Fisher's exact test, P < .00013), TERT (P < .0085), and NOTCH1 (P < .00013). Analysis of clinical courses from the MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kura Oncology, Inc data sets demonstrated poor clinical outcomes with a high rate of recurrence following primary definitive treatment (50%-67% relapse < 6 months) and short disease-free survival (4.0 months; 95% CI, 1.0 to 36.0) and overall survival (OS; 15.0 months; 95% CI, 6.0 to 52.0). Use of tipifarnib in this data set demonstrated improved OS (25.5 months; 95% CI, 18.0 to 48.0). CONCLUSION: Oncogenic mutations in HRAS occur in 3%-4% of HNSCC, with G12S being the most frequent. Without targeted therapy, patients with HRAS-mutant HNSCC had poor clinic outcomes; observable trend toward improvement in OS has been noted in cohorts receiving treatments such as tipifarnib. The comutation pattern of HRAS-mutant in HNSCC is distinct, which may provide insight to future therapeutic combination strategies.", "pmid": "36603172"}
{"abstract_id": "1245", "title": "Endothelial Rap1 (Ras-Association Proximate 1) Restricts Inflammatory Signaling to Protect From the Progression of Atherosclerosis.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Small GTPase Rap1 (Ras-association proximate 1) is a novel, positive regulator of NO release and endothelial function with a potentially key role in mechanosensing of atheroprotective, laminar flow. Our objective was to delineate the role of Rap1 in the progression of atherosclerosis and its specific functions in the presence and absence of laminar flow, to better define its role in endothelial mechanisms contributing to plaque formation and atherogenesis. Approach and Results: In a mouse atherosclerosis model, endothelial Rap1B deletion exacerbates atherosclerotic plaque formation. In the thoracic aorta, where laminar shear stress-induced NO is otherwise atheroprotective, plaque area is increased in Athero-Rap1BiDeltaEC (atherogenic endothelial cell-specific, tamoxifen-inducible Rap1A+Rap1B knockout) mice. Endothelial Rap1 deficiency also leads to increased plaque size, leukocyte accumulation, and increased CAM (cell adhesion molecule) expression in atheroprone areas, whereas vascular permeability is unchanged. In endothelial cells, in the absence of protective laminar flow, Rap1 deficiency leads to an increased proinflammatory TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha) signaling and increased NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activation and elevated inflammatory receptor expression. Interestingly, this increased signaling to NF-kappaB activation is corrected by AKTVIII-an inhibitor of Akt (protein kinase B) translocation to the membrane. Together, these data implicate Rap1 in restricting Akt-dependent signaling, preventing excessive cytokine receptor signaling and proinflammatory NF-kappaB activation. CONCLUSIONS: Via 2 distinct mechanisms, endothelial Rap1 protects from the atherosclerosis progression in the presence and absence of laminar flow; Rap1-stimulated NO release predominates in laminar flow, and restriction of proinflammatory signaling predominates in the absence of laminar flow. Our studies provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying endothelial homeostasis and reveal the importance of Rap1 signaling in cardiovascular disease.", "pmid": "33267664"}

Anti-diabetic activities of TPE and TPE-derived ZnO NPs have been carried out in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced with a single intraperitoneal dosage of the glucose analogue STZ (55 mg/Kg) known to be particularly toxic to pancreatic insulin-producing beta-cells. TPE and TPE-derived ZnO NPs were administered orally, once every day for 21 days in diabetic rats, at 100 and 200 mg/Kg, respectively. The standard antidiabetic medication, glibenclamide, was used as a control at a dose of 10 mg/Kg. Various parameters were investigated, including bodyweight (bw) variations, glycemia, lipidaemia, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and histopathological alterations in the rat's liver and pancreas. The TPE-mediated NPs were small, spherical, stable, and uniform. Compared to TPE and, to a lesser extent, glibenclamide, TPE-derived ZnO NPs lowered blood glucose levels considerably (p < 0.05) and in a dose-dependent manner while preventing body weight loss. Further, positive benefits for both the lipid profile and glycated hemoglobin were also noticed with TPE-derived ZnO NPs. The histopathological assessment revealed that synthesized TPE-derived ZnO NPs are safe, non-toxic, and biocompatible. At 200 mg/Kg/day, TPE-derived ZnO NPs had a more substantial hypoglycemic response than at 100 mg/Kg/day. Thus, in this first reported experimental setting, ZnO NPs biosynthesized from the leaf extract of Tridax procumbens exert more potent anti-diabetic activity than TPE and glibenclamide.

{"abstract_id": "1248", "title": "MEF2 (Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2) Is Essential for Endothelial Homeostasis and the Atheroprotective Gene Expression Program.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Atherosclerosis predominantly forms in regions of oscillatory shear stress while regions of laminar shear stress are protected. This protection is partly through the endothelium in laminar flow regions expressing an anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic gene expression program. Several molecular pathways transmitting these distinct flow patterns to the endothelium have been defined. Our objective is to define the role of the MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2) family of transcription factors in promoting an atheroprotective endothelium. Approach and Results: Here, we show through endothelial-specific deletion of the 3 MEF2 factors in the endothelium, Mef2a, -c, and -d, that MEF2 is a critical regulator of vascular homeostasis. MEF2 deficiency results in systemic inflammation, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and rapid lethality. Transcriptome analysis reveals that MEF2 is required for normal regulation of 3 pathways implicated in determining the flow responsiveness of the endothelium. Specifically, MEF2 is required for expression of Klf2 and Klf4, 2 partially redundant factors essential for promoting an anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic endothelium. This critical requirement results in phenotypic similarities between endothelial-specific deletions of Mef2a/c/d and Klf2/4. In addition, MEF2 regulates the expression of Notch family genes, Notch1, Dll1, and Jag1, which also promote an atheroprotective endothelium. In contrast to these atheroprotective pathways, MEF2 deficiency upregulates an atherosclerosis promoting pathway through increasing the amount of TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif). CONCLUSIONS: Our results implicate MEF2 as a critical upstream regulator of several transcription factors responsible for gene expression programs that affect development of atherosclerosis and promote an anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic endothelium.

Herein, we aimed to evaluate the toxicological, antitumor, and antinociceptive actions of N'-(6-chloro-2-methoxyacridin-9-yl)-2-cyanoacetohydrazide (ACS-AZ), a 9-aminoacridine derivative with antimalarial activity. The toxicity was assessed by acute toxicity and micronucleus tests in mice. The in vivo antitumor effect of ACS-AZ (12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p.) was determined using the Ehrlich tumor model, and toxicity. The antinociceptive efficacy of the compound (50 mg/kg, i.p.) was investigated using formalin and hot plate assays in mice. The role of the opioid system was also investigated. In the acute toxicity test, the LD50 (lethal dose 50%) value was 500 mg/kg (i.p.), and no detectable genotoxic effect was observed. After a 7-day treatment, ACS-AZ significantly (p < 0.05) reduced tumor cell viability and peritumoral microvessels density, suggesting antiangiogenic action. In addition, ACS-AZ reduced (p < 0.05) IL-1beta and CCL-2 levels, which may be related to the antiangiogenic effect, while increasing (p < 0.05) TNF-alpha and IL-4 levels, which are related to its direct cytotoxicity. ACS-AZ also decreased (p < 0.05) oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) levels, both of which are crucial mediators in cancer known for their angiogenic action. Moreover, weak toxicological effects were recorded after a 7-day treatment (biochemical, hematological, and histological parameters). Concerning antinociceptive activity, ACS-AZ was effective on hotplate and formalin (early and late phases) tests (p < 0.05), characteristic of analgesic agents with central action. Through pretreatment with the non-selective (naloxone) and mu1-selective (naloxonazine) opioid antagonists, we observed that the antinociceptive effect of ACS-AZ is mediated mainly by mu1-opioid receptors (p < 0.05). In conclusion, ACS-AZ has low toxicity and antitumoral activity related to cytotoxic and antiangiogenic actions that involve the modulation of reactive oxygen species, NO, and cytokine levels, in addition to antinociceptive properties involving the opioid system.", "pmid": "36324671"}

Overexpression of MTERF1 in the HT29 cell promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and xenograft tumor formation, whereas knockdown of MTERF1 in HCT116 cells appeared to be the opposite phenotype to HT29 cells. Furthermore, MTERF1 can increase mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, transcription, and protein synthesis in colorectal cancer cells; increase ATP levels, the mitochondrial crista density, mitochondrial membrane potential, and oxygen consumption rate (OCR); and reduce the ROS production in colorectal cancer cells, thereby enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity. Mechanistically, we revealed that MTERF1 regulates the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in cancerous cell lines, and we also confirmed the involvement of the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in both xenograft tumor tissues and colorectal cancer tissues. In summary, our data reveal an oncogenic role of MTERF1 in CRC progression, indicating that MTERF1 may represent a new therapeutic target in the future.", "pmid": "36293209"}

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important biological information carriers that mediate local and systemic cell-to-cell communication under healthy and pathological settings. These endogenous vesicles have been identified as important drug delivery vehicles for a variety of therapeutic payloads, including doxorubicin (Dox), with significant benefits over traditional techniques. In this work, EVs were employed as natural drug delivery nanoparticles to load Dox for targeted delivery to retinoblastoma human cell lines (Y-79). Two sub-types of EVs were produced from distinct breast cancer cell lines (4T1 and SKBR3) that express a marker that selectively interacts with retinoblastoma cells and were loaded with Dox, utilizing the cells' endogenous loading machinery. In vitro, we observed that delivering Dox with both EVs increased cytotoxicity while dramatically lowering the dosage of the drug. Dox-loaded EVs, on the other hand, inhibited cancer cell growth by activating caspase-3/7. Direct interaction of EV membrane moieties with retinoblastoma cell surface receptors resulted in an effective drug delivery to cancer cells. Our findings emphasize the intriguing potential of EVs as optimum methods for delivering Dox to retinoblastoma.", "pmid": "36354582"}

However, upregulated HR is also used by cancer cells to promote therapeutic resistance. Therefore, inducing HR deficiency (HRD) is a viable strategy to sensitize HR proficient cancers to DNA targeted therapies in order to overcome therapeutic resistance. A bromodomain containing protein, BRD9, was previously reported to regulate chromatin remodeling and transcription. Here, we discover that following DNA damage, the bromodomain of BRD9 binds acetylated K515 on RAD54 and facilitates RAD54's interaction with RAD51, which is essential for HR. BRD9 is overexpressed in ovarian cancer and depleting BRD9 sensitizes cancer cells to olaparib and cisplatin. In addition, inhibitor of BRD9, I-BRD9, acts synergistically with olaparib in HR-proficient cancer cells. Overall, our results elucidate a role for BRD9 in HR and identify BRD9 as a potential therapeutic target to promote synthetic lethality and overcome chemoresistance.", "pmid": "32457312"}

The current study delineated whether genetic mutations of alpha2* nAChRs (Chrna2L9'S/L9'S and Chrna2KO) influence hippocampus-dependent learning and memory and CA1 synaptic plasticity. We substituted a serine for a leucine (L9'S) in the alpha2 subunit (encoded by the Chrna2 gene) to make a hypersensitive nAChR. Using a dorsal hippocampus-dependent task of preexposure-dependent contextual fear conditioning, adolescent hypersensitive Chrna2L9'S/L9'S male mice exhibited impaired learning and memory. The deficit was rescued by low-dose nicotine exposure. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that hypersensitive alpha2 nAChRs potentiate acetylcholine-induced ion channel flux in oocytes and acute nicotine-induced facilitation of dorsal/intermediate CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation in Chrna2L9'S/L9'S mice. Adolescent male mice null for the alpha2 nAChR subunit exhibited a baseline deficit in learning that was not reversed by an acute dose of nicotine. These effects were not influenced by locomotor, sensory or anxiety-related measures.

Micro-Tom suspension-cultured cells were used to analyze the effect of different elicitors including beta-cyclodextrins (CD), methyl jasmonate (MJ), beta-glucan (Glu) and 3-hexenol (Hex) separately and the combined treatments of CD + MJ, CD + glu and CD + Hex on triterpene compound production after 24, 72 and 96 h. Moreover, we studied the changes induced by elicitors in the expression of key biosynthetic genes to elucidate the regulation of the triterpene biosynthetic pathway. The relative abundance of the triterpene compounds identified in the extracellular medium after elicitation (squalene, fucosterol, avenasterol, beta-sitosterol, cycloartenol and taraxasterol) was determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and the expression level of genes in treated-cells was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results showed that, in CD-treated cells (CD, CD + MJ, CD + Glu, CD + Hex), specialized metabolites were accumulated mainly in the extracellular medium after 72 h of elicitation. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the highest triterpene levels in CD-treated cells (CD, CD + MJ, CD + Glu, CD + Hex) were highly correlated with the expression of cycloartenol synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and squalene epoxidase genes at 24 h of treatment, whereas the expression of sterol methyltransferase was increased at 72 h. According to our findings, CD acts as a true elicitor of triterpene biosynthesis and can promote the release of bioactive compounds from the tomato cells into the extracellular medium. The results obtained provide new insights into the regulation of the triterpene metabolic pathway, which might be useful for implementing metabolic engineering techniques in tomato.", "pmid": "36297806"}

We previously showed that AIIt interacts with the short cytoplasmic domain (12 amino acids) of CEACAM1 (CEACAM1-SF). Since the cytoplasmic domains of CEACAM1 help regulate the formation of cis- or trans-dimers at the cell membrane, we investigated the possible role of their association with AIIt in this process. Using NMR and molecular dynamics, we show that AIIt and its pseudoheterodimer interacts with two molecules of short cytoplasmic domain isoform peptides, and that interaction depends on the binding motif 454-Phe-Gly-Lys-Thr-457 where Phe-454 binds in a hydrophobic pocket of AIIt, the null mutation Phe454Ala reduces binding by 2.5 fold, and the pseudophosphorylation mutant Thr457Glu reduces binding by three fold. Since these two residues in CEACAM1-SF were also found to play a role in the binding of calmodulin and G-actin at the membrane, we hypothesize a sequential set of three interactions are responsible for regulation of cis- to trans-dimerization of CEACAM1. The hydrophobic binding pocket in AIIt corresponds to a previously identified binding pocket for a peptide found in SMARCA3 and AHNAK, suggesting a conserved functional motif in AIIt allowing multiple proteins to reversibly interact with integral membrane proteins in a calcium dependent manner.", "pmid": "32835655"}

However, resistance to BTK inhibitors is a major clinical challenge. We here report that MALT1 is one of the top overexpressed genes in ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells, while expression of CARD11, which is upstream of MALT1, is decreased. MALT1 genetic knockout or inhibition produced dramatic defects in MCL cell growth regardless of ibrutinib sensitivity. Conversely, CARD11-knockout cells showed antitumor effects only in ibrutinib-sensitive cells, suggesting that MALT1 overexpression could drive ibrutinib resistance via bypassing BTK/CARD11 signaling. Additionally, BTK knockdown and MALT1 knockout markedly impaired MCL tumor migration and dissemination, and MALT1 pharmacological inhibition decreased MCL cell viability, adhesion, and migration by suppressing NF-kappaB, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and integrin signaling. Importantly, cotargeting MALT1 with safimaltib and BTK with pirtobrutinib induced potent anti-MCL activity in ibrutinib-resistant MCL cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. Therefore, we conclude that MALT1 overexpression associates with resistance to BTK inhibitors in MCL, targeting abnormal MALT1 activity could be a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome BTK inhibitor resistance, and cotargeting of MALT1 and BTK should improve MCL treatment efficacy and durability as well as patient outcomes.", "pmid": "36719376"}

MATERIAL AND METHODS We recruited 160 PCa cases and 243 healthy controls. For the meta-analysis, relevant studies were recruited from diverse databases up to April 2022. Genetic risk was evaluated by using an odds ratio (OR) with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The genotypes of this polymorphism were genotyped via the SNaPshot genotyping method. RESULTS In the case-control study, we failed to identify any association between the hOGG1 rs1052133 polymorphism and PCa risk. Negative results were also obtained when stratified analyses were performed based on the patient's prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) level and Gleason score, as well as tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage. To enlarge the sample size, we performed a restricted updated meta-analysis by recruiting 10 case-control studies (including the current one), and the results suggested that genotypes of rs1052133 polymorphism were significantly associated with an elevated risk of PCa in 2 genetic models - the heterozygote and dominant models. In the stratification analysis by population ethnicity, a significant association of this polymorphism with susceptibility to PCa was found both in the Asian populations and White populations.

Previous results have demonstrated the synergistic effects between cryptotanshinone (CPT) and imatinib on apoptosis of CML cells in vitro. OBJECTIVE: To determine the antileukemia effects of CPT and TKIs on the resistant CML cells, and further investigate the effect of combined treatment of CPT and imatinib on tumour growth and apoptosis in the xenograft model and clarify its regulatory mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The combination effects of CPT and second-generation TKIs were evaluated in resistant CML cells K562-R. CPT and imatinib were orally administered once daily for 21 days on K562-R xenografts in nude mice (6 per group). Tumour proliferation and apoptosis were examined by Ki-67, PCNA and TUNEL staining. The expression levels of apoptotic markers and activities of STAT3 and eIF4E pathways were determined via immunohistochemistry staining and western blotting analysis. RESULTS: CPT significantly enhanced the antiproliferative effects of TKIs, via triggering cleavages of caspase proteins, and inhibiting activities of STAT3 and eIF4E pathways. The administration of CPT and imatinib dramatically inhibited the tumour growth of xenografts and achieved a suppression of 60.2%, which is 2.6-fold higher than that of single imatinib group. Furthermore, CPT and imatinib increased the apoptotic rates and markedly decreased the phosphorylation levels of STAT3 and eIF4E.

Genetic variants of OPRM1 have been implicated in predisposition to drug addiction, in particular the single nucleotide polymorphism A118G, leading to an N40D substitution, with an allele frequency of 10-32%, and uncertain functions. We have measured allele-specific mRNA expression of OPRM1 in human autopsy brain tissues, using A118G as a marker. In 8 heterozygous samples measured, the A118 mRNA allele was 1.5-2.5-fold more abundant than the G118 allele. Transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells of a cDNA representing only the coding region of OPRM1, carrying adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and thymidine in position 118, resulted in 1.5-fold lower mRNA levels only for OPRM1-G118, and more than 10-fold lower OPRM1 protein levels, measured by Western blotting and receptor binding assay. After transfection and inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D, analysis of mRNA turnover failed to reveal differences in mRNA stability between A118 and G118 alleles, indicating a defect in transcription or mRNA maturation. These results indicate that OPRM1-G118 is a functional variant with deleterious effects on both mRNA and protein yield.

Endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase 1alpha (ERO1alpha) is an oxidase that exists in the luminal side of the ER membrane, participating in protein folding and secretion and inhibiting apoptosis, but the underlying mechanism on liver injury induced by homocysteine (Hcy) remains obscure. In this study, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) mice model was established in cbs+/- mice by feeding a high-methionine diet for 12 weeks; and cbs+/- mice fed with high-methionine diet exhibited more severe liver injury compared to cbs+/+ mice. Mechanistically, we found that Hcy promoted ER stress and apoptosis of hepatocytes and thereby aggravated liver injury through inhibiting ERO1alpha expression; accordingly, overexpression of ERO1alpha remarkably alleviated ER stress and apoptosis of hepatocytes induced by Hcy. Epigenetic modification analysis revealed that Hcy significantly increased levels of DNA methylation and H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) on ERO1alpha promoter, which attributed to upregulated DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and G9a, respectively. Further study showed that DNMT1 and G9a cooperatively regulated ERO1alpha expression in hepatocytes exposed to Hcy.

ANRIL is located at the CDKN2A/B locus, which encodes multiple melanoma tumor suppressors. We investigated the association of these variants with melanoma prognostic characteristics. METHODS: The Genes, Environment, and Melanoma Study enrolled 3,285 European origin participants with incident invasive primary melanoma. For each of ten disease-associated SNPs at or near ANRIL, we used linear and logistic regression modeling to estimate, respectively, the per allele mean changes in log of Breslow thickness and ORs for presence of ulceration and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). We also assessed effect modification by tumor NRAS/BRAF mutational status. RESULTS: Rs518394, rs10965215, and rs564398 passed false discovery and were each associated (P <= 0.005) with TILs, although only rs564398 was independently associated (P = 0.0005) with TILs. Stratified by NRAS/BRAF mutational status, rs564398*A was significantly positively associated with TILs among NRAS/BRAF mutant, but not wild-type, cases.

Its protective effects in several gastrointestinal tumors have been demonstrated, but its effects on bacterial enteritis and pyroptosis-related diseases have rarely been studied. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of quercetin on bacterial enteritis and pyroptosis. Design: In vitro experiments were performed using rat intestinal microvascular endothelial cells divided into seven groups: control group (no treatment), model group (10 mug/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+1 mM adenosine triphosphate [ATP]), LPS group (10 mug/mL LPS), ATP group (1 mM ATP), and treatment groups (10 mug/mL LPS+1 mM ATP and 5, 10, and 20 muM quercetin). The expression of pyroptosis-associated proteins, inflammatory factors, tight junction proteins, and the percentage of late apoptotic and necrotic cells were measured. In vivo analysis was performed using specific pathogen-free Kunming mice pretreated with quercetin and the water extract of Cacumen Platycladi for 2 weeks followed by 6 mg/kg LPS on day 15.

Although not commonly known, alcohol can have a significant impact on the respiratory environment. Living in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, alcohol misuse can have a particularly deleterious effect on SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and, in turn, the overall healthcare system. Patients with alcohol use disorders have higher odds of COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality. Even though the detrimental role of alcohol on COVID-19 outcomes has been established, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully understood. Alcohol misuse has been shown to induce oxidative damage in the lungs through the production of reactive aldehydes such as malondialdehyde and acetaldehyde (MAA). MAA can then form adducts with proteins, altering their structure and function. One such protein is surfactant protein D (SPD), which plays an important role in innate immunity against pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we examined whether MAA adduction of SPD (SPD-MAA) attenuates the ability of SPD to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, reversing SPD-mediated virus neutralization. Using ELISA, we show that SPD-MAA is unable to competitively bind spike protein and prevent ACE2 receptor binding. Similarly, SPD-MAA fails to inhibit entry of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus into Calu-3 cells, a lung epithelial cell line, as well as ciliated primary human bronchial epithelial cells isolated from healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, MAA adduction of SPD, a consequence of alcohol overconsumption, represents one mechanism of compromised lung innate defense against SARS-CoV-2, highlighting a possible mechanism underlying COVID-19 severity and related mortality in patients who misuse alcohol.", "pmid": "36352814"}

Here, we aimed to prospectively investigate the interactive effects of genetic variants-from a genome-wide approach-and early life stress (ELS) on child subcortical brain structures, and their association with subsequent mental health problems. Method: Primary analyses were conducted using data from the Generation R Study (N = 2257), including genotype and cumulative prenatal and postnatal ELS scores (encompassing life events, contextual risk, parental risk, interpersonal risk, direct victimisation). Neuroimaging data were collected at age 10 years, including intracranial and subcortical brain volumes (accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus). Genome-wide association and genome-wide-by-environment interaction analyses (GWEIS, run separately for prenatal/postnatal ELS) were conducted for eight brain outcomes (i.e., 24 genome-wide analyses) in the Generation R Study (discovery). Polygenic scores (PGS) using the resulting weights were calculated in an independent (target) cohort (adolescent brain cognitive development Study; N = 10,751), to validate associations with corresponding subcortical volumes and examine links to later mother-reported internalising and externalising problems. Results: One GWEIS-prenatal stress locus was associated with caudate volume (rs139505895, mapping onto PRSS12 and NDST3) and two GWEIS-postnatal stress loci with the accumbens (rs2397823 and rs3130008, mapping onto CUTA, SYNGAP1, and TABP). Functional annotation revealed that these genes play a role in neuronal plasticity and synaptic function, and have been implicated in neuro-developmental phenotypes, for example, intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. None of these associations survived a more stringent correction for multiple testing across all analysis sets.

Adoption of innovative medicines may be further optimized, and better transparency of the availability of new medicines during different phases of the postapproval access pathway is needed. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study reviewed approval and reimbursement decisions of the CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib and estimated the number of patients with metastatic breast cancer who were eligible for these medicines compared with the actual use in clinical practice. The study used nationwide claims data that were obtained from the Dutch Hospital Data. Claims and early access data for patients with hormone receptor-positive and ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer who were treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors from November 1, 2016, to December 31, 2021, were included. Importance: The number of new cancer medicines that are being approved by regulatory agents is increasing exponentially. Yet little is known about the pace at which these medicines reach eligible patients in daily clinical practice during different phases of the postapproval access pathway. Main Outcomes and Measures: Description of the postapproval access pathway, monthly number of patients who were treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors in clinical practice, and estimated number of patients who were eligible for treatment. Aggregated claims data were used, and patient characteristics and outcomes data were not collected. Objective: To describe the entire postapproval access pathway of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors in the Netherlands, from regulatory approval to reimbursement and to investigate the adoption of these medicines in clinical practice among patients with metastatic breast cancer. Results: Three CDK4/6 inhibitors have received European Union-wide regulatory approval for the treatment of HR-positive and ERBB2-negative metastatic breast cancer since November 2016. In the Netherlands, the number of patients who have been treated with these medicines increased to approximately 1847 (based on 1 624 665 claims over the entire study period) from approval to the end of 2021. Reimbursement for these medicines was granted between 9 and 11 months after approval. While awaiting reimbursement decisions, 492 patients received palbociclib, the first approved medicine of this class, via an expanded access program. By the end of the study period, 1616 patients (87%) were treated with palbociclib, whereas 157 patients (7%) received ribociclib, and 74 patients (4%) received abemaciclib. The CKD4/6 inhibitor was combined with an aromatase inhibitor in 708 patients (38%) and with fulvestrant in 1139 patients (62%). The pattern of use over time appeared to be somewhat lower compared with the estimated number of eligible patients (1847 vs 1915 in December 2021), especially in the first 2.5 years after approval.", "pmid": "36795415"}

The activity of CYP3A4 is known to be modulated by several compounds and by the electron transfer partner, cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). The underlying mechanism of these effects, however, is poorly understood. We have used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to investigate the impact of binding of CPR and of three different substrates (7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin, testosterone, and progesterone) on the conformational dynamics of CYP3A4. Here, we report that interaction of CYP3A4 with substrates or with the oxidized or reduced forms of CPR leads to a global rigidification of the CYP3A4 structure. This was evident from the suppression of deuterium exchange in several regions of CYP3A4, including regions known to be involved in protein-protein interactions (helix C) and substrate binding and specificity (helices B' and E, and loop K/beta1). Furthermore, the bimodal isotopic distributions observed for some CYP3A4-derived peptides were drastically impacted upon binding to CPR and/or substrates, suggesting the existence of stable CYP3A4 conformational populations that are perturbed by ligand/CPR binding. The results have implications for understanding the mechanisms of ligand binding, allostery, and catalysis in CYP enzymes.", "pmid": "34196520"}

Of at least 21 BBS-related genes that can carry multiple mutations, a pathogenic mutation, BBS1M390R, is the single most common mutation of clinically diagnosed BBS outcomes. While the deletion of BBS-related genes in mice can cause variable penetrance in different organ systems, the impact of the Bbs1M390R mutation in the olfactory system remains unclear. Using a clinically relevant knock-in mouse model homozygous for Bbs1M390R, we investigated the impact of the mutation on the olfactory system and tested the potential of viral-mediated, wildtype gene replacement therapy to rescue smell loss. The cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in Bbs1M390R/M390R mice were significantly shorter and fewer than those of wild-type mice. Also, both peripheral cellular odor detection and synaptic-dependent activity in the olfactory bulb were significantly decreased in the mutant mice. Furthermore, to gain insight into the degree to which perceptual features are impaired in the mutant mice, we used whole-body plethysmography to quantitatively measure odor-evoked sniffing. The Bbs1M390R/M390R mice showed significantly higher odor detection thresholds (reduced odor sensitivity) compared to wild-type mice; however, their odor discrimination acuity was still well maintained. Importantly, adenoviral expression of Bbs1 in OSNs restored cilia length and re-established both peripheral odorant detection and odor perception. Together, our findings further expand our understanding for the development of gene therapeutic treatment for congenital ciliopathies in the olfactory system.", "pmid": "34383976"}

Additionally, the role of KCNJ15 in epilepsy has not been evaluated so far. METHODS: Here, we performed differentially expressed gene analysis, expression quantitative trait loci analysis, gene co-expression analysis, and protein-protein interaction analysis to evaluate the role of KCNJ15 in epilepsy. RESULTS: Analysis of gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci data revealed that KCNJ15 was significantly downregulated in patients with epilepsy (adjusted P = 0.0146 and log2 Fold change = - 1.0025), and an epilepsy-associated polymorphism (rs2833098) was linked to altered KCNJ15 expression level in human temporal lobe brain tissue (P = 0.0036). Gene co-expression analysis revealed that KCNJ15 was co-expressed with genes that have been reported to be associated with epilepsy in human brain tissue. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction analysis revealed strong supportive evidence for the role of KCNJ15 in epilepsy. CONCLUSION: Our results show that KCNJ15 may be a candidate target for epilepsy. Functional analysis of KCNJ15 may provide novel insights for epilepsy treatment.", "pmid": "36168094"}

The aim of this analysis was to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel compared to ticagrelor in these patients aged 70 years or older with NSTEMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 1-year decision tree based on the POPular AGE trial in combination with a lifelong Markov model was developed to compare clopidogrel with ticagrelor in terms of clinical outcomes, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in elderly patients (above 70 year) with NSTEMI. Cost-effectiveness was assessed from a Dutch healthcare system perspective. Events rates and utility data observed in the POPular AGE trial were combined with lifetime projections to evaluate costs and effects for a fictional cohort of 1000 patients. Treatment with clopidogrel instead of ticagrelor led to a cost saving of $1484 575 ($1485 per patient) and a decrease of 10.96 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.011 QALY per patient) in the fictional cohort. In an alternative base case with equal distribution over health states in the first year, treatment with clopidogrel led to an increase in QALYs. In all scenario analyses, treatment with clopidogrel was cost saving. CONCLUSION: Clopidogrel is a cost-saving alternative to ticagrelor in elderly patients after NSTEMI, though regarding overall cost-effectiveness clopidogrel was not superior to ticagrelor, as it resulted in a small negative effect on QALYs. However, based on the results of the alternative base case and clinical outcomes of the POPular AGE trial, clopidogrel could be a reasonable alternative to ticagrelor for elderly NSTEMI patients with a higher bleeding risk.", "pmid": "35723240"}

We here tested its potential effect against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative injury in osteoblasts. In primary murine and human osteoblasts, iKeap1 robustly activated Nrf2 signaling at micromole concentrations. iKeap1 disrupted Keap1-Nrf2 association, causing Nrf2 protein stabilization, cytosol accumulation and nuclear translocation in murine and human osteoblasts. The anti-oxidant response elements (ARE) activity and transcription of Nrf2-ARE-dependent genes (including HO1, NQO1 and GCLC) were increased as well. Significantly, iKeap1 pretreatment largely ameliorated H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage as well as cell apoptosis and programmed necrosis in osteoblasts. Moreover, dexamethasone- and nicotine-induced oxidative injury and apoptosis were alleviated by iKeap1. Importantly, Nrf2 shRNA or CRISPR/Cas9-induced Nrf2 knockout completely abolished iKeap1-induced osteoblast cytoprotection against H2O2. Conversely, CRISPR/Cas9-induced Keap1 knockout induced Nrf2 cascade activation and mimicked iKeap1-induced cytoprotective actions in murine osteoblasts. iKeap1 was ineffective against H2O2 in the Keap1-knockout murine osteoblasts. Collectively, iKeap1 activated Nrf2 signaling cascade to inhibit H2O2-induced oxidative injury and death of osteoblasts.", "pmid": "34226516"}

Germ line mutations in BRAF have not been identified as causal in families predisposed to melanoma. However, a recent study suggested that a BRAF haplotype was associated with risk of sporadic melanoma in men. Polymorphisms or other variants in the BRAF gene may therefore act as candidate low-penetrance genes for nevus/melanoma susceptibility. We hypothesized that promoter variants would be the most likely candidates for determinants of risk. Using denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography and sequencing, we screened peripheral blood DNA from 184 familial melanoma cases for BRAF promoter variants. We identified a promoter insertion/deletion in linkage disequilibrium with the previously described BRAF polymorphism in intron 11 (rs1639679) reported to be associated with melanoma susceptibility in males. We therefore investigated the contribution of this BRAF polymorphism to melanoma susceptibility in 581 consecutively recruited incident cases, 258 incident cases in a study of late relapse, 673 female general practitioner controls, and the 184 familial cases. We found no statistically significant difference in either genotype or allele frequencies between cases and controls overall or between male and female cases for the BRAF polymorphism in the two incident case series. Our results therefore suggest that the BRAF polymorphism is not significantly associated with melanoma and the promoter insertion/deletion linked with the polymorphism is not a causal variant.

However, there have been very few studies on the impact of Hsp90 inhibitors on pain or analgesia, a serious concern for cancer patients. We previously found that Hsp90 inhibitors injected into the brain block opioid-induced antinociception in tail flick, paw incision, and HIV neuropathy pain. This study extended from that initial work to test the cancer-related clinical impact of Hsp90 inhibitors on opioid antinociception in cancer-induced bone pain in female BALB/c mice and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in male and female CD-1 mice. Mice were treated with Hsp90 inhibitors (17-AAG, KU-32) by the intracerebroventricular, intrathecal, or intraperitoneal routes, and after 24 hours, pain behaviors were evaluated after analgesic drug treatment. Heat shock protein 90 inhibition in the brain or systemically completely blocked morphine and oxymorphone antinociception in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy; this effect was partly mediated by decreased ERK and JNK MAPK activation and by increased protein translation, was not altered by chronic treatment, and Hsp90 inhibition had no effect on gabapentin antinociception. We also found that the Hsp90 isoform Hsp90alpha and the cochaperone Cdc37 were responsible for the observed changes in opioid antinociception. By contrast, Hsp90 inhibition in the spinal cord or systemically partially reduced opioid antinociception in cancer-induced bone pain. These results demonstrate that Hsp90 inhibitors block opioid antinociception in cancer-related pain, suggesting that Hsp90 inhibitors for cancer therapy could decrease opioid treatment efficacy.", "pmid": "32701840"}

Angiopoietin-like proteins 3 (ANGPTL3) and 4 (ANGPTL4) are critical regulators of TG metabolism that function by inhibiting the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is responsible for hydrolyzing triglycerides in lipoproteins into free fatty acids. Interestingly, individuals with loss-of-function mutations in ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 have low plasma TG levels, have a reduced risk of CHD, and are otherwise healthy. Consequently, interventions targeting ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 have emerged as promising new approaches for reducing elevated TGs. Here, we developed virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccines that target the LPL binding domains of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4. ANGPTL3 VLPs and ANGPTL4 VLPs are highly immunogenic in mice and vaccination with ANGPTL3 VLPs, but not ANGPTL4 VLPs, was associated with reduced steady state levels of TGs. Immunization with ANGPTL3 VLPs rapidly cleared circulating TG levels following an oil gavage challenge and enhanced plasma LPL activity. These data indicate that targeting ANGPTL3 by active vaccination is a potential alternative to other ANGPTL3-inhibiting therapies.", "pmid": "34474934"}

Nevertheless, the therapeutic effect of luteolin on the depression-related dry eye disorder remains inconclusive. In this study, C57 mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress in a dry environment (relative humidity in the cage <40%). The behavioral test and phenol red cotton thread test were employed to select the mice with both dry eye and depression-like behavior. The mechanism of luteolin on depression-related dry eye disorder was assessed by the Sirt1 selective inhibitor EX-527. Luteolin alleviated depressive-like behaviors induced by CUMS, increased tear secretion and restored corneal defects in mice. The secretions of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-alpha were decreased in hippocampi and corneal tissues by Luteolin treatment. Luteolin treatment up-regulated Sirt1 expression and down-regulated Ac-NF-kappaB, NLRP3, Ac-Caspase-1, GSDMD-N, Cleaved IL-1beta, and Cleaved IL-18 expressions. In addition, the selective inhibition of Sirt1 could weaken the therapeutic effect of luteolin on depression-related dry eye disorder.

O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the enzyme that catalyzes the covalent addition of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of proteins, is often highly expressed in prostate cancer with its expression correlated with high Gleason score. In this study, we have identified an AR and OGT coregulated factor, Vpr (HIV-1) binding protein (VPRBP) also known as DDB1 and CUL4 Associated Factor 1 (DCAF1). We show that VPRBP is regulated by the AR at the transcript level, and stabilized by OGT at the protein level. VPRBP knockdown in prostate cancer cells led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, p53 stabilization, nucleolar fragmentation, and increased p53 recruitment to the chromatin. In human prostate tumor samples, VPRBP protein overexpression correlated with AR amplification, OGT overexpression, a shorter time to postoperative biochemical progression and poor clinical outcome. In clinical transcriptomic data, VPRBP expression was positively correlated with the AR and also with AR activity gene signatures.

Differences in RRM sequences dictate, in part, both RNA and protein-binding specificities and affinities. We used a deep mutational scanning approach to study the sequence-function relationship of the RRM2 domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1). By scoring the activity of more than 100,000 unique Pab1 variants, including 1246 with single amino acid substitutions, we delineated the mutational constraints on each residue. Clustering of residues with similar mutational patterns reveals three major classes, composed principally of RNA-binding residues, of hydrophobic core residues, and of the remaining residues. The first class also includes a highly conserved residue not involved in RNA binding, G150, which can be mutated to destabilize Pab1. A comparison of the mutational sensitivity of yeast Pab1 residues to their evolutionary conservation reveals that most residues tolerate more substitutions than are present in the natural sequences, although other residues that tolerate fewer substitutions may point to specialized functions in yeast. An analysis of ~40,000 double mutants indicates a preference for a short distance between two mutations that display an epistatic interaction. As examples of interactions, the mutations N139T, N139S, and I157L suppress other mutations that interfere with RNA binding and protein stability.

Recently, oncogene Cyclophilin B (CypB) is reported to be induced by cholesterol. However, the role of CypB in CRC carcinogenesis and metastasis associated with HFD remains unknown. In the present study, we showed that HFD-induced CypB enhances proliferation and metastasis through an inflammation-driven circuit, including Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3)-triggered transcription of lncRNA-PVT1, and its binding with CypB that promotes activation of STAT3. CypB was found to be upregulated in CRC, which was correlated with elevated body mass index and poor prognosis. HFD induced CypB expression and proinflammatory cytokines in colon of mice. Besides, CypB restoration facilitated growth, invasion and metastasis in CRC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, RIP sequencing data identified lncRNA-PVT1 as a functional binding partner of CypB. Mechanistically, PVT1 increased the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 in response to IL-6, through directly interaction with CypB, which impedes the binding of Suppressors Of Cytokine Signalling 3 (SOCS3) to STAT3. Furthermore, STAT3 in turn activated PVT1 transcription through binding to its promoter, forming a regulatory loop. Finally, this CypB/STAT3/PVT1 axis was verified in TCGA datasets and CRC tissue arrays.

Non-drug therapy and lifestyle interventions have become important means to prevent the occurrence and progression of AD, with nutritional therapy being one such example. Nutritional therapy, as a non-pharmacological intervention for AD, has made significant progress and shown significant promise for the development of treatment regimens in recent years. Niacin is a critical vitamin available in the forms of nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinic acid (NA). In tissues, niacin is transformed into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are involved in a variety of cellular processes. Recent researches indicate that niacin may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of aging, cancer, and metabolic illnesses. Methods: To detect the mechanism of affection of niacin in AD, we found out GSE135999 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database which is microarray data containing samples of 24 wild-type (WT) and 24 APP/PS1 AD mice, given either nicotinamide riboside (NR; 12 mM) or nothing (CTR) in their drinking water. We conducted a more reliable data analysis method Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to confirm the central players (hub genes) and related pathways associated between niacin and AD. To validate the affection of niacin in AD mice, we selected 6 WT and 12 APP/PS1 transgenic mice, the 12 APP/PS1 mice were treated with a niacin acid supplement diet or normal food. Six months later, behavioral tests were performed.

The aim of this study was to outline acute and sub-chronic effects by nicotine on the female rat brain, with special emphasis on neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a key brain region with respect to the formation of habits. Methods: In vivo microdialysis and ex vivo electrophysiology were performed in nicotine naive female Wistar rats, and following sub-chronic nicotine exposure (0.36 mg/kg free base, 15 injections). Locomotor behavior was assessed at the first and last drug-exposure. Results: Acute exposure to nicotine ex vivo depresses excitatory neurotransmission by reducing the probability of transmitter release. Bath applied nicotine furthermore facilitated long-term synaptic depression induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS-LTD). The cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) agonist WIN55,212-2 produced a robust synaptic depression of evoked potentials, and HFS-LTD was blocked by the CB1R antagonist AM251, suggesting that HFS-LTD in the female rat DLS is endocannabinoid mediated. Sub-chronic exposure to nicotine in vivo produced behavioral sensitization and electrophysiological recordings performed after 2-8 days abstinence revealed a sustained depression of evoked population spike amplitudes in the DLS, with no concomitant change in paired pulse ratio. Rats receiving sub-chronic nicotine exposure further demonstrated an increased neurophysiological responsiveness to nicotine with respect to both dopaminergic- and glutamatergic signaling. However, a tolerance towards the plasticity facilitating property of bath applied nicotine was developed during sub-chronic nicotine exposure in vivo. In addition, the dopamine D2 receptor agonist quinpirole selectively facilitate HFS-LTD in slices from nicotine naive rats, suggesting that the tolerance may be associated with changes in dopaminergic signaling.

It is usually caused by an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, but in a small number of patients deletions and point mutations have been identified. We screened all 17 exons of the FMR1 gene for mutations in 90 autistic or mentally retarded children using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. No mutations were found in 76 male patients. However, one female patient was heterozygous for a normal allele and a mutant allele with an A to C substitution at nucleotide 879 in exon 9. This mutation was not found in 50 controls. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that a large proportion of the mutant transcripts were spliced aberrantly, causing premature termination of the protein synthesis. Although uncommon, point mutations in the FMR1 gene may be a cause of autism and mental retardation in Japanese patients.", "pmid": "15000256"}

This study aimed to investigate the effect of suramin on chondrocyte differentiation and its underlying mechanism. METHODS: Porcine chondrocytes were treated with vehicle or various doses of suramin. The expression of collagen, type II, alpha 1 (COL2A1), aggrecan (ACAN); COL1A1; COL10A1; SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9); nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX); interleukin (IL)-1beta; tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha); IL-8; and matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP-13) in chondrocytes at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. In addition, the supplementation of suramin to redifferentiation medium for the culture of expanded chondrocytes in 3D pellets was evaluated. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen production were evaluated by biochemical analyses and immunofluorescence, as well as by immunohistochemistry. The expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NOX activity were assessed by luciferase reporter gene assay, immunofluorescence analysis, and flow cytometry. Mutagenesis analysis, Alcian blue staining, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and western blot assay were used to determine whether p67phox was involved in suramin-enhanced chondrocyte phenotype maintenance. RESULTS: Suramin enhanced the COL2A1 and ACAN expression and lowered COL1A1 synthesis. Also, in 3D pellet culture GAG and COL2A1 production was significantly higher in pellets consisting of chondrocytes expanded with suramin compared to controls. Surprisingly, suramin also increased ROS generation, which is largely caused by enhanced NOX (p67phox) activity and membrane translocation. Overexpression of p67phox but not p67phoxAD (deleting amino acid (a.a) 199 to 212) mutant, which does not support ROS production in chondrocytes, significantly enhanced chondrocyte phenotype maintenance, SOX9 expression, and AKT (S473) phosphorylation. Knockdown of p67phox with its specific short hairpin (sh) RNA (shRNA) abolished the suramin-induced effects. Moreover, when these cells were treated with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) inhibitor LY294002 or shRNA of AKT1, p67phox-induced COL2A1 and ACAN expression was significantly inhibited. CONCLUSION: Suramin could redifferentiate dedifferentiated chondrocytes dependent on p67phox activation, which is mediated by the PI3K/AKT/SOX9 signalling pathway.Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2022;11(10):693-708.", "pmid": "36222195"}

Forebrain-specific conditional Cn knockout mice have been known to exhibit multiple behavioral phenotypes related to these disorders. In this study, we investigated whether Cn mutant mice show pseudo-immaturity of the dentate gyrus (iDG) in the hippocampus, which we have proposed as an endophenotype shared by these disorders. Expression of calbindin and GluA1, typical markers for mature DG granule cells (GCs), was decreased and that of doublecortin, calretinin, phospho-CREB, and dopamine D1 receptor (Drd1), markers for immature GC, was increased in Cn mutants. Phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) substrates (GluA1, ERK2, DARPP-32, PDE4) was increased and showed higher sensitivity to SKF81297, a Drd1-like agonist, in Cn mutants than in controls. While cAMP/PKA signaling is increased in the iDG of Cn mutants, chronic treatment with rolipram, a selective PDE4 inhibitor that increases intracellular cAMP, ameliorated the iDG phenotype significantly and nesting behavior deficits with nominal significance. Chronic rolipram administration also decreased the phosphorylation of CREB, but not the other four PKA substrates examined, in Cn mutants. These results suggest that Cn deficiency induces pseudo-immaturity of GCs and that cAMP signaling increases to compensate for this maturation abnormality. This study further supports the idea that iDG is an endophenotype shared by certain neuropsychiatric disorders.", "pmid": "36414974"}

Tumor angiogenesis is a critical process during cancer progression, as it modulates carcinogenesis and metastasis. In recent years, microRNA-218 (miR-218) has been confirmed to play a crucial role in tumor suppression. However, the role of miR-218 in RCC angiogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, it was found that the expression of miR-218 was decreased in RCC tumor tissues and cell lines as detected by real-time PCR analysis. Tube formation assays and migration assays also confirmed that miR-218 inhibited the interaction between RCC cells and vascular endothelial cells by suppressing proangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in RCC cells. miR-218 also repressed the subcutaneous tumorigenesis of RCC cells in nude mice, and the corneal angiogenesis in rabbit eyes. The underlying molecular mechanism was elucidated; miR-218 targets GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2), thereby inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/VEGFA pathway. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of RCC carcinogenesis and progression, suggesting that miRNA-218 may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of RCC.", "pmid": "32901879"}

To better understand the effects of azole antifungal drugs (ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole) on pyrotinib's pharmacokinetics, DDIs between pyrotinib and three azoles were studied with Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat liver microsomes in vitro. Additionally, in vivo pyrotinib metabolic experiment was also performed. Twenty-four male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: the ketoconazole (40 mg/kg), fluconazole (40 mg/kg), itraconazole (40 mg/kg), and the control group. UPLC-MS/MS was used for the determination of Pyrotinib's plasma concentration in rats. In vitro experiments showed that IC50 values of ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole were 0.06, 11.55, and 0.27 muM, respectively, indicating that these drugs might reduce the clearance rate of pyrotinib at different degrees. In rat studies, coadministration of pyrotinib with ketoconazole or fluconazole could dramatically increase the Cmax and AUC(0-t) values and decrease the clearance rate of pyrotinib, especially for ketoconazole. However, coadministration with itraconazole had no impact on the pharmacokinetic characters of pyrotinib. These data indicated that ketoconazole and fluconazole could significantly decrease the metabolism of pyrotinib both in vitro and in vivo.

We analyzed 337 patients and 840 controls from the Hungarian National Pancreas Registry either by direct sequencing of exon 7 and the flanking noncoding regions or by TaqMan SNP genotyping assays.

Nevertheless, knowledge of the physiological relevance and regulation of InsP3Rs in atrial muscle is still limited. We hypothesize that InsP3R and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) form a functional signaling domain where NOX2 derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate InsP3R agonist affinity and thereby Ca2+ release. To quantitate the contribution of IICR to atrial excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) atrial myocytes (AMs) were isolated from wild type and NOX2 deficient (Nox2-/-) mice and changes in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i; fluo-4/AM, indo-1) or ROS (2',7'-dichlorofluorescein, DCF) were monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Superfusion of AMs with Angiotensin II (AngII: 1 mumol/L) significantly increased diastolic [Ca2+]i (F/F0, Ctrl: 1.00 +- 0.01, AngII: 1.20 +- 0.03; n = 7; p < 0.05), the field stimulation induced Ca2+ transient (CaT) amplitude (DeltaF/F0, Ctrl: 2.00 +- 0.17, AngII: 2.39 +- 0.22, n = 7; p < 0.05), and let to the occurrence of spontaneous increases in [Ca2+]i. These changes in [Ca2+]i were suppressed by the InsP3R blocker 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl-borate (2-APB; 1 mumol/L). Concomitantly, AngII induced an increase in ROS production that was sensitive to the NOX2 specific inhibitor gp91ds-tat (1 mumol/L). In NOX2-/- AMs, AngII failed to increase diastolic [Ca2+]i, CaT amplitude, and the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ increases. Furthermore, the enhancement of CaTs by exposure to membrane permeant InsP3 was abolished by NOX inhibition with apocynin (1 muM). AngII induced IICR in Nox2-/- AMs could be restored by addition of exogenous ROS (tert-butyl hydroperoxide, tBHP: 5 mumol/L). In saponin permeabilized AMs InsP3 (5 mumol/L) induced Ca2+ sparks that increased in frequency in the presence of ROS (InsP3: 9.65 +- 1.44 sparks*s-1*(100mum)-1; InsP3 + tBHP: 10.77 +- 1.5 sparks*s-1*(100mum)-1; n = 5; p < 0.05). The combined effect of InsP3 + tBHP was entirely suppressed by 2-APB and Xestospongine C (XeC). Changes in IICR due to InsP3R glutathionylation induced by diamide could be reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT: 1 mmol/L) and prevented by pretreatment with 2-APB, supporting that the ROS-dependent post-translational modification of the InsP3R plays a role in the regulation of ECC. Our data demonstrate that in AMs the InsP3R is under dual control of agonist induced InsP3 and ROS formation and suggest that InsP3 and NOX2-derived ROS co-regulate atrial IICR and ECC in a defined InsP3R/NOX2 signaling domain.", "pmid": "34755642"}

Low fluid shear stress (FSS) is a key pathological factor for many cardiovascular diseases, which directly forces on the endothelial cells of vessel walls. So far, the alterations and functions of m6A modifications in vascular endothelial cells at the low FSS are still unknown. Herein, we performed the transcriptome-wide m6A modification profiling of HUVECs at different FSS. We found that the m6A modifications were altered earlier and more sensitive than mRNA expressions in response to FSS. The low FSS increased the m6A modifications at CDS region but decreased the m6A modifications at 3' UTR region and regulated both the mRNA expressions and m6A modifications of the m6A regulators, such as the RBM15 and EIF3A. Functional annotations enriched by the hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes at low FSS revealed that the m6A modifications were clustered in the aging-related signaling pathways of mTOR, PI3K-AKT, insulin, and ERRB and in the oxidative stress-related transcriptional factors, such as HIF1A, NFAT5, and NFE2L2. Our study provided a pilot view of m6A modifications in vascular endothelial cells at low FSS and revealed that the m6A modifications driven by low FSS mediated the cellular responses to oxidative stress and cell aging, which suggested that the m6A modifications could be the potential targets for inhibiting vascular aging at pathological low FSS.", "pmid": "36743697"}

However, the molecular mechanism by which FOXL2C134W contributes to tumorigenesis is not known. Here, we show that mutant FOXL2C134W acquires the ability to bind SMAD4, forming a FOXL2C134W/SMAD4/SMAD2/3 complex that binds a novel hybrid DNA motif AGHCAHAA, unique to the FOXL2C134W mutant. This binding induced an enhancer-like chromatin state, leading to transcription of nearby genes, many of which are characteristic of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. FOXL2C134W also bound hybrid loci in primary AGCT. Ablation of SMAD4 or SMAD2/3 resulted in strong reduction of FOXL2C134W binding at hybrid sites and decreased expression of associated genes. Accordingly, inhibition of TGFbeta mitigated the transcriptional effect of FOXL2C134W. Our results provide mechanistic insight into AGCT pathogenesis, identifying FOXL2C134W and its interaction with SMAD4 as potential therapeutic targets to this condition. SIGNIFICANCE: FOXL2C134W hijacks SMAD4 and leads to the expression of genes involved in EMT, stemness, and oncogenesis in AGCT, making FOXL2C134W and the TGFbeta pathway therapeutic targets in this condition.

Serum levels of lipid are associated with the response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy, while single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around the human interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene locus and amino acid substitutions in the core region of the HCV have been reported to affect the efficacy of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy in chronic hepatitis with HCV genotype 1b infection. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between serum lipid and factors that are able to predict the efficacy of PEG-IFN/RB therapy, with specific focus on apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) in 148 subjects with chronic HCV G1b infection. Our results demonstrated that both the aa 70 substitution in the core region of the HCV and the rs8099917 SNP located proximal to the IL28B were independent factors in determining serum apoB-100 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. A significant association was noted between higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 1.1 10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02) and the subjects having Arg70. A significant association was also observed between subjects carrying the rs8099917 TT responder genotype and higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 6.4 10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 4.2 10(-3)). Our results suggest that apoB-100 and LDL cholesterol are markers of impaired cellular lipoprotein pathways and/or host endogenous interferon response to HCV in chronic HCV infection.

Adipose tissue is the most peripheral site of aromatase enzyme synthesis; therefore, the excessive accumulation of visceral fat results in increased androgens aromatization and estradiol production that provides the microenvironment favorable to tumorigenesis in mammary epithelial cells expressing estrogen receptors (ERs). Moreover, to meet the increased requirement of cholesterol for cell membrane assembly and the production of steroid hormones to sustain their proliferation, ER-positive cells activate de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and subsequent steroidogenesis. Several approaches have been followed to neutralize the de novo cholesterol synthesis, including specific enzyme inhibitors, statins, and, more recently, metformin. Cumulating evidence indicated that inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis by statins and metformin may be a promising therapeutic strategy to block breast cancer progression. Unlike antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) which compete for binding to ER and inhibit androgens aromatization, respectively, statins block the production of mevalonic acid by inhibiting the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and metformin hampers the activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) transcription factor, thus inhibiting the synthesis of several enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis.

Somatic mutations in genes involved in oncogenic signaling pathways, including KRAS and TP53, rewire the metabolic machinery in cancer cells. We here set out to determine, at the single cell level, metabolic signatures in human colon cancer cells engineered to express combinations of activating KRAS gene mutations and TP53 gene deletions. Specifically, we explored how somatic mutations in these genes and substrate availability (lactate, glucose, substrate deprivation) from the extracellular microenvironment affect bioenergetic parameters, including cellular ATP, NADH and mitochondrial membrane potential dynamics. Employing cytosolic and mitochondrial FRET-based ATP probes, fluorescent NADH sensors, and the membrane-permeant cationic fluorescent probe TMRM in HCT-116 cells as a model system, we observed that TP53 deletion and KRAS mutations drive a shift in metabolic signatures enabling lactate to become an efficient metabolite to replenish both ATP and NADH following nutrient deprivation. Intriguingly, cytosolic, mitochondrial and overall cellular ATP measurements revealed that, in WT KRAS cells, TP53 deficiency leads to an enhanced ATP production in the presence of extracellular lactate and glucose, and to the greatest increase in ATP following a starvation period. On the other hand, oncogenic KRAS in TP53-deficient cells reversed the alterations in cellular ATP levels. Moreover, cell population measurements of mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism using a Seahorse analyzer demonstrated that WT KRAS TP53-silenced cells display an increase of the basal respiration and tightly-coupled mitochondria, in the presence of glucose as substrate, compared to TP53 competent cells. Furthermore, cells possessing oncogenic KRAS, independently of TP53 status, showed less pronounced mitochondrial membrane potential changes in response to metabolic nutrients. Furthermore, analysis of cytosolic and mitochondrial NADH levels revealed that the simultaneous presence of TP53 deletion and oncogenic KRAS showed the most pronounced alteration in cytosolic and mitochondrial NADH during metabolic stress. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate how activating KRAS mutation and loss of TP53 remodel cancer metabolism and lead to alterations in bioenergetics under metabolic stress conditions by modulating cellular ATP production, NADH oxidation, mitochondrial respiration and function.", "pmid": "36238683"}

In this study, we constructed a mouse model of DM by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin, and then induced postoperative cognitive dysfunction by transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. We found that mouse models of DM-POCD exhibited the most serious cognitive impairment, as well as the most hippocampal neural stem cells (H-NSCs) loss and neurogenesis decline. Subsequently, we hypothesized that small extracellular vesicles secreted by induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSC-sEVs) might promote neurogenesis and restore cognitive function in patients with DM-POCD. iMSC-sEVs were administered via the tail vein beginning on day 2 after surgery, and then once every 3 days for 1 month thereafter. Our results showed that iMSC-sEVs treatment significantly recovered compromised proliferation and neuronal-differentiation capacity in H-NSCs, and reversed cognitive impairment in mouse models of DM-POCD. Furthermore, miRNA sequencing and qPCR showed miR-21-5p and miR-486-5p were the highest expression in iMSC-sEVs.

The STRUM server also confirmed that the mutation decreased its protein stability. Thus, LDB3 mutation may be associated with heritable HCM. To our knowledge, this is the first time to report LDB3 heterozygous variants (R547Q and P323S) responsible for heritable HCM.", "pmid": "36452351"}

Here, we showed that RANK ligand stimulation enhances NFAM1 expression in preosteoclast cells. Conditioned media collected from RANKL stimulated RAW264.7 NFAM1 knockdown (KD) stable cells showed inhibition of interleukin-6 (2.5-fold), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (2.2-fold) and CXCL-5 (3-fold) levels compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Further, RANKL stimulation significantly increased p-STAT6 expression (5.5-fold) in WT cells, but no significant effect was observed in NFAM1-KD cells. However, no changes were detected in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 levels in either of cell groups. Interestingly, NFAM1-KD suppressed the RANKL stimulated c-fos, p-c-Jun and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity in preosteoclasts. We further showed that the suppression of JNK activity is through inhibition of p-SAPK/JNK in these cells. In addition, NFATc1 expression, a critical transcription factor associated with osteoclastogenesis is significantly inhibited in NFAM1-KD preosteoclast cells. Interestingly, NFAM1 inhibition suppressed the OCL differentiation and bone resorption capacity in mouse bone marrow cell cultures. We also demonstrated inhibition of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase expression in RANKL stimulated NFAM1-KD preosteoclast cells. Thus, our results suggest that NFAM1 control SAPK/JNK signaling to modulate osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.", "pmid": "34228377"}

Therefore, investigating biomarkers associated with disease severity is important for understanding the mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity and for developing novel agents to prevent critical conditions. This study aimed to elucidate the modulations of sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids, which have been shown to possess potent biological properties. METHODS: We measured the serum sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid levels in a total of 887 samples from 215 COVID-19 subjects, plus 115 control subjects without infectious diseases and 109 subjects with infectious diseases other than COVID-19. RESULTS: We observed the dynamic modulations of sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids in the serum of COVID-19 subjects, depending on the time course and severity. The elevation of C16:0 ceramide and lysophosphatidylinositol and decreases in C18:1 ceramide, dihydrosphingosine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol were specific to COVID-19. Regarding the association with maximum severity, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine species with long unsaturated acyl chains were negatively associated, while lysophosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylethanolamine were positively associated with maximum severity during the early phase. Lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine had strong negative correlations with CRP, while phosphatidylethanolamine had strong positive ones. C16:0 ceramide, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine species with long unsaturated acyl chains had negative correlations with D-dimer, while phosphatidylethanolamine species with short acyl chains and phosphatidylinositol had positive ones. Several species of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin might serve as better biomarkers for predicting severe COVID-19 during the early phase than CRP and D-dimer. Compared with the lipid modulations seen in mice treated with lipopolysaccharide, tissue factor, or histone, the lipid modulations observed in severe COVID-19 were most akin to those in mice administered lipopolysaccharide. CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the disturbances in sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids observed in this study will prompt further investigation to develop laboratory testing for predicting maximum severity and/or novel agents to suppress the aggravation of COVID-19.", "pmid": "36214754"}

While the corrector function of VX-445 is well established, here we investigated the putative potentiator activity of VX-445 alone and in combination with VX-770. Acute addition of VX-445 increased the VX-770-potentiated F508del- and G551D-CFTR current by ~24% and >70%, respectively, in human bronchial and nasal epithelia. Combinatorial profiling and cluster analysis of G551D- and G1244E-CFTR channel activation with potentiator pairs indicated a distinct VX-445 mechanism of action that is, at least, additive to previously identified potentiator classes, including the VX-770. Since VX-770 only partially normalizes the G551D-CFTR channel function and adult G551D patients still experience progressive loss of lung function, VX-445+VX-770 combination therapy could provide clinical benefit to CF patients with the G551D and other dual potentiator responsive mutants.", "pmid": "33775603"}

However, a large gap in knowledge exists concerning how the integration of intracellular signaling molecules coordinates a persistent inflammatory phenotype. Herein, we demonstrate that Raf Kinase Anchoring Protein (RKIP) interrupts a vital canonical desensitization pathway to maintain bradykinin (BK) receptor activation in primary afferent neurons. Biochemical analyses of primary neuronal cultures indicate bradykinin-stimulated PKC phosphorylation of RKIP at Ser153. Furthermore, BK exposure increases G-protein Receptor Kinase 2 (GRK2) binding to RKIP, inhibiting pharmacological desensitization of the BK receptor. Additional studies found that molecular RKIP down-regulation increases BK receptor desensitization in real-time imaging of primary afferent neurons, identifying a key pathway integrator in the desensitization process that controls multiple GRK2-sensitive G-protein coupled receptors. Therefore, RKIP serves as an integral scaffolding protein that inhibits BK receptor desensitization.", "pmid": "35526109"}

The binding affinity of the porphyrin derivative with human serum albumin was determined using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and predicted using molecular docking. We conclude that the studied porphyrin photosensitizer binds to human serum albumin and may inhibit the cancer cell line through its interactions with HIS and MET AA residues from BCL-2, MCL-1, and beta-catenin receptors or through its low estimated free energy of binding when interacting with A1 and BCL-B receptors.", "pmid": "36365208"}

In this study, we observed that lncRNA CCDC26 was upregulated in both chronic and acute ML cell lines. LncRNA CCDC26 promoted the proliferation and invasion of K562 and HL-60 cells, which was determined by cell counting kit-8 test and Transwell invasion assay. Flow cytometry showed that lncRNA CCDC26 inhibited cell apoptosis. Bioinformatics and expression correlation analyses revealed that there was a potential interaction between CCDC26 and CUGBP Elav-like family member 2 (CELF2) protein, an RNA bind protein (RBP). Then the relationship between CCDC26 and the RBP CELF2 was identified by using RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) assays. Further analysis showed that overexpression of CCDC26 could noticeably upregulate circRNA_ANKIB1 expression via sponging CELF2. Subsequently, we found that overexpressed circRNA_ANKIB1 could significantly promote proline rich 11 (PRR11) protein expression by sponging miR-195a-5p. Moreover, PRR11 was also upregulated by CCDC26 and downregulated by CELF2. Mechanically, we uncovered that the miR-195a-5p inhibitor activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) pathways through upregulating PRR11 protein expression.

The mechanism was intensively investigated by assay against the 3 x Tg-AD mice with brain-specific PPM1A knockdown (KD) through AAV-ePHP-KD-PPM1A injection. MF alleviated neuronal tauopathy involving microglia/neurons crosstalk by both promoting microglial phagocytosis of tau oligomers via PPM1A/Nuclear factor-kappab (NF-kappaB)/C-X3-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 1 (CX3CR1) signaling and inhibiting neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation via PPM1A/NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3)/tau axis.

MAIN METHODS: Since NNK-dependent transformation can be abolished by the nicotinergic secreted mammalian Ly-6/urokinase plasminogen activator receptor related protein-1 (SLURP-1), we compared effects of NNK and recombinant (r)SLURP-1 on the expression of genes related to tumorigenesis in human immortalized bronchial and oral epithelial cell lines BEP2D and Het-1A, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: NNK stimulated expression of oncogenic genes, including MYB and PIK3CA in BEP2D, ETS1, NRAS and SRC in Het-1A, and AKT1, KIT and RB1 in both cell types, which could be abolished in the presence of rSLURP-1. Other cancer-related genes whose upregulation by NNK was abolishable by rSLURP-1 were the growth factors EGF in BEP2D cells and HGF in Het-1A cells, and the transcription factors CDKN2A and STAT3 (Het-1A only). NNK also upregulated the anti-apoptotic BCL2 (Het-1A) and downregulated the pro-apoptotic TNF (Het-1A), BAX and CASP8 (BEP2D), all of which could be abolished, in part, by rSLURP-1. NNK decreased expression of the CTNNB1 gene encoding the intercellular adhesion molecule beta-catenin (BEP2D), as well as tumor suppressors CDKN3 and FOXD3 in BEP2D cells and SERPINB5 in Het-1A cells. These pro-oncogenic effects of NNK were abolished by rSLURP-1 that also upregulated RUNX3.

In multiple tumour-bearing animal models, the engineered hiPSC-derived CAR T cells led to therapeutic outcomes similar to those of primary CD8 T cells bearing the same CAR.

METHODS: Thirty lumbar laminectomized adult rats were randomly assigned to three groups. The control group received normal saline, the HCA group received HA-CMC-alginate gel, and the HA group received pure HA gel soaked over the dura of the laminectomized area before closing the surgical wound. All rats were housed for eight weeks, then epidural fibrosis (EF) was histologically graded. In addition, the fibroblast and inflammatory cell density were computerized for evaluation. RESULTS: The mean fibroblast densities were 32.03 x 102 +- 488, 13.22 x 102 +- 200, and 14.52 x 102 +- 368 cell/mm2 in the control, HCA, and HA groups, respectively.

Previous studies have shown the antitumoral actions of the dietary omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in both tumor epithelial and stromal components of the breast cancer microenvironment. Particularly in breast cancer cells, DHA can be converted into its conjugate with ethanolamine, DHEA, leading to a more effective anti-oncogenic activity of the parent compound in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells. Here, we investigated the ability of DHEA to attenuate the malignant phenotype of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 TNBC cell lines, which in turn influenced TAM behaviors. Our findings revealed that DHEA reduced the viability of TNBC cells in a concentration-dependent manner and compromised cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, DHEA inhibited oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates, reducing respiration and the glycolytic reserve in both cell lines. In a co-culture system, TNBC cells exposed to DHEA suppressed recruitment of human THP-1 cells, reduced their viability, and the expression of genes associated with TAM phenotype. Interestingly, we unraveled that the effects of DHEA in TNCB cells were mediated by reduced C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) expression and secretion affecting macrophage recruitment.

However, SCCHN resistance to platinum compounds is well documented. The resistance to platinum has been linked to the activity of divalent transporter ATP7B, which pumps platinum from the cytoplasm into lysosomes, decreasing its concentration in the cytoplasm. Several cancer models show increased expression of ATP7B; however, the reason for such an increase is not known. Here we show a strong positive correlation between mRNA levels of TMEM16A and ATP7B in human SCCHN tumors. TMEM16A overexpression and depletion in SCCHN cell lines caused parallel changes in the ATP7B mRNA levels. The ATP7B increase in TMEM16A-overexpressing cells was reversed by suppression of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), by the antioxidant N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) and by copper chelation using cuprizone and bathocuproine sulphonate (BCS). Pretreatment with either chelator significantly increased cisplatin's sensitivity, particularly in the context of TMEM16A overexpression. We propose that increased oxidative stress in TMEM16A-overexpressing cells liberates the chelated copper in the cytoplasm, leading to the transcriptional activation of ATP7B expression. This, in turn, decreases the efficacy of platinum compounds by promoting their vesicular sequestration. We think that such a new explanation of the mechanism of SCCHN tumors' platinum resistance identifies novel approach to treating these tumors.", "pmid": "31790150"}

In this study, amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced C. elegans models of AD were used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying calcium homeostasis in AD. Calcium acetate increased the intracellular calcium content, exacerbated Abeta 1-42 aggregation, which is closely associated with oxidative stress, aggravated neuronal degeneration and dysfunction, and shortened the lifespan of the C. elegans models. Ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and nimodipine were used to decrease the intracellular calcium content. Both EGTA and nimodipine showed remarkable inhibitory effects on Abeta 1-42 aggregations by increasing oxidative stress resistance. Moreover, both compounds significantly delayed the onset of Abeta-induced paralysis, rescued memory deficits, ameliorated behavioral dysfunction, decreased the vulnerability of two major (GABAergic and dopaminergic) neurons and synapses, and extended the lifespan of the C. elegans AD models. Furthermore, RNA sequencing of nimodipine-treated worms revealed numerous downstream differentially expressed genes related to calcium signaling. Nimodipine-induced inhibition of selective voltage-gated calcium channels was shown to activate other calcium channels of the plasma membrane (clhm-1) and endoplasmic reticulum (unc-68), in addition to sodium-calcium exchanger channels (ncx-1).

Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) belongs to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily and was initially identified as macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1). GDF15 is considered a cytokine with an anti-inflammatory effect and increases insulin sensitivity, reduces body weight, and improves clinical outcomes in diabetic patients. GDF15 acts through stimulation of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor alpha-like (GFRAL), which is highly expressed in the brain stem to induce taste aversion. Metformin belongs to the group of biguanides that are derived from the plant Galega officinalis. It is interesting to note that metformin is an insulin-sensitizing agent used as a first-line therapy for T2DM that has been shown to increase the circulating level of GDF15. Thus, the present review aims to determine the critical association of the GDF15 biomarker in T2DM and how metformin agents affect it. This review illustrates that metformin activates GDF15 expression, which reduces appetite and leads to weight loss in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients.

This toxin-based MEK inactivator exhibits potent activity against a wide range of solid tumors, with the highest activity seen when directed toward tumors containing the BRAFV600E mutation. We demonstrate that this reengineered MEK inactivator also exhibits an extremely high therapeutic index (>15), due to its in vitro and in vivo activity being strictly dependent on the expression of multiple tumor-associated factors including tumor-associated proteases matrix metalloproteinase, urokinase plasminogen activator, and anthrax toxin receptor capillary morphogenesis protein-2.

With ageing, DNA methylation of FHL2 increases, as well as expression of the four and a half LIM domains 2 (FHL2) protein in human pancreatic islets. We hypothesised that FHL2 is actively involved in glucose metabolism. METHODS: Publicly available microarray datasets from human pancreatic islets were analysed for FHL2 expression. In FHL2-deficient mice, we studied glucose clearance and insulin secretion. Gene expression analysis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) were determined in isolated murine FHL2-deficient islets to evaluate insulin-secretory capacity. Moreover, knockdown and overexpression of FHL2 were accomplished in MIN6 cells to delineate the underlying mechanism of FHL2 function. RESULTS: Transcriptomics of human pancreatic islets revealed that individuals with elevated levels of HbA1c displayed increased FHL2 expression, which correlated negatively with insulin secretion pathways. In line with this observation, FHL2-deficient mice cleared glucose more efficiently than wild-type littermates through increased plasma insulin levels. Insulin sensitivity was comparable between these genotypes. Interestingly, pancreatic islets isolated from FHL2-deficient mice secreted more insulin in GSIS assays than wild-type mouse islets even though insulin content and islet size was similar. To support this observation, we demonstrated increased expression of the transcription factor crucial in insulin secretion, MAF BZIP transcription factor A (MafA), higher expression of GLUT2 and reduced expression of the adverse factor c-Jun in FHL2-deficient islets. The underlying mechanism of FHL2 was further delineated in MIN6 cells. FHL2-knockdown led to enhanced activation of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and its downstream genes such as Mafa and Pdx1 (encoding pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1), as well as increased glucose uptake. On the other hand, FHL2 overexpression in MIN6 cells blocked GSIS, increased the formation of reactive oxygen species and increased c-Jun activity. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data demonstrate that FHL2 deficiency improves insulin secretion from beta cells and improves glucose tolerance in mice. Given that FHL2 expression in humans increases with age and that high expression levels of FHL2 are associated with beta cell dysfunction, we propose that enhanced FHL2 expression in elderly individuals contributes to glucose intolerance and the development of type 2 diabetes.

Ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2) is a key enzyme in DNA synthesis and repair. The present study investigated the effect of RRM2 on osteogenesis of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and its molecular mechanism. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that RRM2 expression was increased during osteogenesis of MEFs triggered by bone morphogenetic protein 9. Subsequently, MEFs were used as a mesenchymal stem cell model and osteogenic inducing medium was used to induce osteogenic differentiation. RRM2 protein expression was measured by western blotting during osteogenic differentiation induction of MEFs. RRM2 levels in MEFs were upregulated and downregulated by RRM2-overexpressing recombinant adenovirus and small interfering RNA-RRM2, respectively. Bone formation markers (RUNX family transcription factor 2, osterix, distal-less homeobox 5, collagen type I alpha1 chain, osteopontin and osteocalcin) were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) PCR and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin Red S staining were examined. The protein expression levels of beta-catenin and the ratio of phosphorylated (p-)GSK-3beta to GSK-3beta were detected by western blotting and the RNA expression of downstream related target genes (beta-catenin, axis inhibition protein 2 (AXIN2), transcription factor 7 like 2, lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1, c-MYC and Cyclin D1) in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was measured by RT-qPCR. RRM2 protein expression increased as the osteogenic differentiation induction period was extended. RRM2 overexpression increased osteogenic marker RNA expression, ALP activity, bone mineralization, the protein expression levels of beta-catenin, the ratio of p-GSK-3beta to GSK-3beta and the RNA expression of downstream related target genes in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, whereas RRM2 knockdown had the opposite effect. The findings of the present study revealed that RRM2 overexpression enhanced osteogenic differentiation, while RRM2 knockdown reduced osteogenic differentiation. RRM2 may regulate osteogenic differentiation of MEFs via the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, providing a possible therapeutic target for osteoporosis.", "pmid": "36160885"}

The aim of the article is to examine the effects of two different causes of hyperammonemia-increased ATP degradation in muscles during strenuous exercise and impaired ammonia detoxification to urea due to liver cirrhosis. During exercise, glycolysis, citric acid cycle (CAC) activity, and ATP synthesis in muscles increase. In cirrhosis, due to insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction, glycolysis, CAC activity, and ATP synthesis in muscles are impaired. Both during exercise and in liver cirrhosis, there is increased ammonia detoxification to glutamine (Glu + NH3 + ATP   Gln + ADP + Pi), increased drain of ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) from CAC for glutamate synthesis by alpha-KG-linked aminotransferases, glutamate, aspartate, and alpha-KG deficiency, increased oxidation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA; valine, leucine, and isoleucine), and protein-energy wasting in muscles. It is concluded that ammonia can contribute to muscle wasting regardless of the cause of its increased levels and that similar strategies can be designed to increase muscle performance in athletes and reduce muscle loss in patients with hyperammonemia. The pros and cons of glutamate, alpha-KG, aspartate, BCAA, and branched-chain keto acid supplementation are discussed.", "pmid": "36295872"}

Rats were divided into three groups: sham, VCM and VCM plus erdosteine. VCM was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 200mgkg(-1) twice daily for 7 days. Erdosteine was administered orally. VCM administration to control rats significantly increased renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG, a marker of renal tubular injury) excretion but decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. Erdosteine administration with VCM injections caused significantly decreased renal MDA and urinary NAG excretion, and increased SOD activity, but not CAT activity in renal tissue when compared with VCM alone. Erdosteine showed histopathological protection against VCM-induced nephrotoxicity. There were a significant dilatation of tubular lumens, extensive epithelial cell vacuolization, atrophy, desquamation, and necrosis in VCM-treated rats more than those of the control and the erdosteine groups. Erdosteine caused a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage. It is concluded that oxidative tubular damage plays an important role in the VCM-induced nephrotoxicity and the modulation of oxidative stress with erdosteine reduces the VCM-induced kidney damage both at the biochemical and histological levels.", "pmid": "16112787"}

These drugs trap TOP1 on DNA, stabilizing the TOP1-cleavage complex (TOP1-cc). The accumulation of TOP1-ccs perturbs DNA replication fork progression, leading to DNA breaks and cell death. By analyzing the genomic occupancy and activity of TOP1, we show that cells adapt to treatment with multiple doses of TOP1 inhibitor by promoting the degradation of TOP1-ccs, allowing cells to better tolerate subsequent doses of TOP1 inhibitor. The E3-RING Cullin 3 ligase in complex with the BTBD1 and BTBD2 adaptor proteins promotes TOP1-cc ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. NEDDylation of Cullin 3 activates this pathway, and inhibition of protein NEDDylation or depletion of Cullin 3 sensitizes cancer cells to TOP1 inhibitors.

Damaged endothelial glycocalyx leads to vascular permeability, lung edema and inflammation. However, whether hyperoxia increases neonatal pulmonary microvascular permeability by degrading the endothelial glycocalyx remains unknown. Methods: Newborn mice were maintained in 60-70% O2 for 7 days. Protectin DX (PDX), an endogenous lipid mediator, was injected intraperitoneally on postnatal d 0, 2, 4 and 6. Lung samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were taken at the end of the study. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in 80%O2. Results: Hyperoxia exposure for 7 days led to neonatal mice alveolar simplification with less radial alveolar count (RAC), mean linear intercept (MLI) and mean alveolar diameter (MAD) compared to the control group. Hyperoxia exposure increased lung vascular permeability with more fluid and proteins and inflammatory factors, including TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid while reducing the heparan sulfate (HS), the most abundant component of the endothelial glycocalyx, in the pulmonary endothelial cells. PDX relieve these changes. PDX attenuated hyperoxia-induced high expression of heparanase (HPA), the endoglycosidase that shed endothelial glycocalyx, p-P65, P65, and low expression of SIRT1. BOC-2 and EX527 abolished the affection of PDX both in vivo and intro.

In recent years, DHE has received extensive attention due to its various pharmacological activities. This review is the first to comprehensively summarize the current studies on pharmacokinetics profiles, pharmacological properties, and toxicological risks of DHE in diverse diseases. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that DHE has a relatively good oral absorption effect in the mean concentration curves in rat plasma and high absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, distribution re-absorption and enterohepatic circulation may lead to multiple blood concentration peaks of DHE in rat plasma. DHE possesses a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties in the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and digestive system. Moreover, DHE has anti-inflammatory effects via downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Given the favorable pharmacological activity, DHE is expected to be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, chronic stress, amnesia, chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcers, and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, toxicity studies have suggested that DHE has proarrhythmic effects and can impair bile acid homeostasis without causing hepatotoxicity. However, further rigorous and well-designed studies are needed to elucidate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacological effects, potential biological mechanisms, and toxicity of DHE.", "pmid": "36467053"}
{"abstract_id": "1333", "title": "Alternative splicing of the tumor suppressor ASPP2 results in a stress-inducible, oncogenic isoform prevalent in acute leukemia.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Apoptosis-stimulating Protein of TP53-2 (ASPP2) is a tumor suppressor enhancing TP53-mediated apoptosis via binding to the TP53 core domain. TP53 mutations found in cancers disrupt ASPP2 binding, arguing for an important role of ASPP2 in TP53-mediated tumor suppression. We now identify an oncogenic splicing variant, ASPP2kappa, with high prevalence in acute leukemia. METHODS: An mRNA screen to detect ASPP2 splicing variants was performed and ASPP2kappa was validated using isoform-specific PCR approaches. Translation into a genuine protein isoform was evaluated after establishing epitope-specific antibodies. For functional studies cell models with forced expression of ASPP2kappa or isoform-specific ASPP2kappa-interference were created to evaluate proliferative, apoptotic and oncogenic characteristics of ASPP2kappa. FINDINGS: Exon skipping generates a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated C-terminus, omitting the TP53-binding sites. ASPP2kappa translates into a dominant-negative protein variant impairing TP53-dependent induction of apoptosis. ASPP2kappa is expressed in CD34+ leukemic progenitor cells and functional studies argue for a role in early oncogenesis, resulting in perturbed proliferation and impaired induction of apoptosis, mitotic failure and chromosomal instability (CIN) - similar to TP53 mutations. Importantly, as expression of ASPP2kappa is stress-inducible it defines a novel class of dynamic oncogenes not represented by genomic mutations. INTERPRETATION: Our data demonstrates that ASPP2kappa plays a distinctive role as an antiapoptotic regulator of the TP53 checkpoint, rendering cells to a more aggressive phenotype as evidenced by proliferation and apoptosis rates - and ASPP2kappa expression results in acquisition of genomic mutations, a first initiating step in leukemogenesis. We provide proof-of-concept to establish ASPP2kappa as a clinically relevant biomarker and a target for molecule-defined therapy.

The genetic basis underlying disease susceptibility in the remaining 50% to 75% of patients with HDGC is still unknown. Objective: To assess the incidence rate of CDH1 germline alterations in HDGC, identify new susceptibility genes that can be used for screening of HDGC, and provide a genetic landscape for HDGC. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study conducted retrospective whole-exome and targeted sequencing of 284 leukocyte samples and 186 paired tumor samples from Chinese patients with HDGC over a long follow-up period (median, 21.7 [range, 0.6-185.9] months). Among 10 431 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer between January 1, 2002, and August 31, 2018, 284 patients who met the criteria for HDGC were included. Data were analyzed from August 1 to 30, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence rate of CDH1 germline alterations, identification of new HDGC susceptibility genes, and genetic landscape of HDGC. Results: Among 284 Chinese patients, 161 (56.7%) were female, and the median age was 35 (range, 20-75) years. The frequency of CDH1 germline alterations was 2.8%, whereas the frequency of CDH1 somatic alterations was 25.3%. The genes with the highest incidence (>10%) of private germline alterations (including insertions and deletions) in the HDGC cohort were MUC4, ABCA13, ZNF469, FCGBP, IGFN1, RNF213, and SSPO, whereas previously reported germline alterations of CTNNA1, BRCA2, STK11, PRSS1, ATM, MSR1, PALB2, BRCA1, and RAD51C were observed at low frequencies (median, 4 [range, 1-12] cases). Furthermore, enrichment of the somatic variant signature of exposure to aflatoxin suggested potential interaction between genetics and environment in HDGC. Double-hit events in genes such as CACNA1D were observed, which suggested that these events might serve as important mechanisms for HDGC tumorigenesis. In addition, germline variants of FSIP2, HSPG2, and NCKAP5 and somatic alterations of FGFR3, ASPSCR1, CIC, DGCR8, and LZTR1 were associated with poor overall survival among patients with HDGC. Conclusions and Relevance: This study provided a genetic landscape for HDGC. The study's findings challenged the previously reported high germline alteration rate of CDH1 in HDGC and identified new potential susceptibility genes. Analyses of variant signatures and double-hit events revealed potentially important mechanisms for HDGC tumorigenesis.

The PPARalpha-FGF21 axis protects against alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). FGF21 exerts its effect via FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1). However, liver specific FGFR1 abrogation had no effect on ALD. Adipose tissues highly express FGFR1. When adipocyte specific FGFR1 knockout (fgfr1adipoQ-cre) mice and corresponding normal control (fgfr1fl/fl) mice were fed with Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet for 3 weeks, liver triglyceride (TG) accumulation was increased in the fgfr1fl/fl mice to a greater extent than in the fgfr1adipoQ-cre mice. When PPARalpha agonist WY-14,643 was added in the liquid ethanol diet at 10 mg/L, the ethanol-induced liver TG accumulation was blunted in the fgfr1fl/fl mice but not in the fgfr1adipoQ-cre mice. There was no significant difference in WY-14,643-induced fatty acid oxidation, ethanol metabolism, and oxidative stress between the fgfr1fl/fl and fgfr1adipoQ-cre mice. Interestingly, adipose atrophy was induced by WY-14,643 in the fgfr1adipoQ-cre mice but not in the fgfr1fl/fl mice. Serum free fatty acid was also decreased by WY-14,643 in the fgfr1adipoQ-cre mice but not in the fgfr1fl/fl mice.

EMCV infection causes abortion in pregnant sows and myocarditis in piglets. Our previous studies demonstrated that curcumol significantly increased the expression of IFN-beta in EMCV infected HEK-293T cells. The present results showed that curcumol inhibits EMCV replication by interfering the host cell cholesterol homeostasis and reducing ROs production through activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. METHOD: This study was designed to explore whether curcumol can inhibit the replication of encephalomyocarditis viruses (EMCV) in cell culture. The expression level of JAK1, IRF9, STAT2, P-STAT2, CH25H, PI4KA and OSBP in EMCV-infected HEK-293T cells treated with curcumol, ribavirin or hydroxypropyl-beta-CD (HPCD) were determined by Western blotting (WB). The cholesterol level in EMCV infected HEK-293T cells treated with curcumol and HPCD were detected using Amplex  Red Cholesterol Assay Kit. The antiviral effects of curcumol and HPCD on EMCV were also quantitatively detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (q-PCR). The amount and morphology of ROs were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: The results demonstrated that curcumol significantly (P < 0.05) increased the expression of JAK1, IRF9, P-STAT2 and CH25H proteins, while that of STAT2, PI4KA and OSBP were remained unchanged. Compared with virus group (0.134 mug.mug-1 proteins), the total cholesterol level was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by curcumol (0.108 mug.mug-1 proteins) and HPCD (0.089 mug.mug-1 proteins). Compared with virus group (88237 copies), curcumol (41802 copies) and HPCD (53 copies) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced EMCV load. Curcumol significantly reduced the production of ROs in EMCV-infected HEK-293T cells and activated CH25H through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an epithelial-derived cytokine that is regarded as the master switch that initiates and maintains the type 2 immune response in allergic rhinitis (AR). However, the molecular mechanisms by which USP25 regulates TSLP signaling in the nasal epithelium in AR remain unclear. The present study assessed the protein expression levels of USP25 in the nasal epithelium of patients with AR. Moreover, USP25 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with ovalbumin (OVA) to establish a model of AR. The results of western blotting and immunohistochemistry in the present study demonstrated that the protein expression levels of USP25 were significantly decreased in the nasal mucosa of patients with AR and AR mice, whereas the protein expression levels of TSLP were significantly increased. Allergic inflammation was more severe in USP25 KO mice compared with WT mice exposed to OVA, as demonstrated by increased nose scratching and sneezing, increased eosinophil infiltration, goblet cell hyperplasia and enhanced T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine production. The results of in vitro experiments demonstrated that silencing or overexpression of USP25 decreased or increased TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) protein expression levels, respectively, in human nasal epithelial cells, whereas TSLP protein expression levels were negatively associated with the expression of USP25 and TRAF3.

Concerning rs9514828, the frequency of C/T genotype was significantly higher in HCV-CV than in HCV. The difference in the distribution of the T/T mutant genotype in HCV-CV compared to HCV was significant as well as the distribution of C/T and T/T genotype in HCV-NHL versus HCV. T minor allele was more frequent in HCV-NHL and HCV-CV than in HCV.

The objective of this study was to explore the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that affect competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) regulation mechanism with the risk and prognosis of HCC. METHODS: Based on a set of bioinformatics strategies, eight lncRNA genes that affect HCC through the mechanism of lncRNA-mediated ceRNA were systematically screened, and 15 SNPs that affect microRNA (miRNA) binding in these lncRNA genes were annotated. Genotyping was performed in 800 HCC cases and 801 healthy controls to examine associations of these SNPs with HCC in a northeastern Chinese Han population. RESULTS: The GG, GC and GG + GC genotypes of HOTAIR rs7958904 were associated with a 0.65, 0.59 and 0.63-fold decreased HCC risk, respectively.

Mild psoriatic patients with a/a genotypes have higher vitamin D levels than severe patients with A/A genotypes and A/a moderate patients (P<=0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicated clearly that VDR gene polymorphism, namely ApaI, is associated with psoriasis susceptibility. Furthermore, serum vitamin D level in psoriatic patients varies among different ApaI genotypes, where it is lowest in AA genotype.", "pmid": "36686134"}

Here, we detail the safety profile of talazoparib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men received talazoparib 1 mg/day (moderate renal impairment 0.75 mg/day) orally until radiographic progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator decision, consent withdrawal, or death. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated: incidence, severity, timing, duration, potential overlap of selected AEs, dose modifications/discontinuations due to AEs, and new clinically significant changes in laboratory values and vital signs. RESULTS: In the safety population (N = 127; median age 69.0 years), 95.3% (121/127) experienced all-cause treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Most common were anemia (48.8% [62/127]), nausea (33.1% [42/127]), decreased appetite (28.3% [36/127]), and asthenia (23.6% [30/127]). Nonhematologic TEAEs were generally grades 1 and 2. No grade 5 TEAEs or deaths were treatment-related. Hematologic TEAEs typically occurred during the first 4-5 months of treatment. The median duration of grade 3-4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia was limited to 7-12 days. No grade 4 events of anemia or neutropenia occurred. Neither BRCA status nor alteration origin significantly impacted the safety profile. The median (range) treatment duration was 6.1 (0.4-24.9) months; treatment duration did not impact the incidence of anemia. Only 3 of the 15 (11.8% [15/127]) permanent treatment discontinuations were due to hematologic TEAEs (thrombocytopenia 1.6% [2/127]; leukopenia 0.8% [1/127]). CONCLUSION: Common TEAEs associated with talazoparib could be managed through dose modifications/supportive care. Demonstrated efficacy and a manageable safety profile support continued evaluation of talazoparib in mCRPC. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03148795.", "pmid": "36124924"}

One of the most prominent examples is the FDA-approved pharmacological chaperone lumacaftor (VX-809), which has transformed cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy. CF is a fatal disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). VX-809 corrects folding of F508del CFTR, the most common patient mutation, yet F508del exhibits only mild VX-809 response. In contrast, rarer mutations P67L and L206W are hyperresponsive to VX-809, while G85E is nonresponsive. Despite the clinical success of VX-809, the mechanistic origin for the distinct susceptibility of mutants remains unclear. Here we use interactomics to characterize the impact of VX-809 on proteostasis interactions of P67L and L206W and compare these with F508del and G85E. We determine that hyperresponsive mutations P67L and L206W exhibit decreased interactions with proteasomal and autophagy degradation machinery compared with F508del and G85E. We then show inhibiting the proteasome attenuates P67L and L206W VX-809 response. Our data suggest a previously unidentified but required role for protein degradation in VX-809 correction. Furthermore, we present an approach for identifying proteostasis characteristics of mutant-specific therapeutic response to pharmacological chaperones.", "pmid": "35389766"}
{"abstract_id": "1345", "title": "Dexmedetomidine Attenuates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Sympathetic Activation and Sepsis via Suppressing Superoxide Signaling in Paraventricular Nucleus.", "abstract": "Sympathetic overactivity contributes to the pathogenesis of sepsis. The selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine (DEX) is widely used for perioperative sedation and analgesia. We aimed to determine the central roles and mechanisms of DEX in attenuating sympathetic activity and inflammation in sepsis. Sepsis was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. Effects of DEX were investigated 24 h after injection of LPS. Bilateral microinjection of DEX in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) attenuated LPS-induced sympathetic overactivity, which was attenuated by the superoxide dismutase inhibitor DETC, cAMP analog db-cAMP or GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine. Superoxide scavenger tempol, NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin, adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 or PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMP caused similar effects to DEX in attenuating LPS-induced sympathetic activation. DEX inhibited LPS-induced superoxide and cAMP production, as well as NADPH oxidase, adenylate cyclase and PKA activation. The roles of DEX in reducing superoxide production and NADPH oxidase activation were attenuated by db-cAMP or gabazine. Intravenous infusion of DEX inhibited LPS-induced sympathetic overactivity, NOX activation, superoxide production, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta upregulation in the PVN and plasma, as well as lung and renal injury, which were attenuated by the PVN microinjection of yohimbine and DETC. We conclude that activation of alpha2-adrenergic receptors with DEX in the PVN attenuated LPS-induced sympathetic overactivity by reducing NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production via both inhibiting adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA signaling and activating GABAA receptors. The inhibition of NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production in the PVN partially contributes to the roles of intravenous infusion of DEX in attenuating LPS-induced sympathetic activation, oxidative stress and inflammation.", "pmid": "36552603"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This first-in-human dose-escalation study (NCT02152943) enrolled patients with hormone receptor- positive, HER2-positive (defined by amplification, overexpression, or mutation) treatment-refractory advanced cancers to receive escalating doses (3+3 design) of daily oral letrozole (days 1-21), daily oral everolimus (days 1-21), and intravenous trastuzumab (day 1) every 21 days to determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and MTD or recommended phase II dose (RP2D). RESULTS: A total of 32 patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive (amplification, n = 27; overexpression, n = 1; and mutation, n = 4) advanced breast cancer (n = 26) or other cancers (n = 6) were enrolled. The most frequent grade >=3 adverse events included hyperglycemia (n = 4), anemia (n = 3), thrombocytopenia (n = 2), and mucositis (n = 2). DLTs included grade 3 mucositis and grade 4 neutropenia, and trastuzumab given as an 8 mg/kg loading dose on day 1 of cycle 1 followed by a 6 mg/kg maintenance dose on day 1 of subsequent cycles plus 10 mg everolimus daily and 2.5 mg letrozole daily every 21 days was declared as RP2D.

Methods: The basic demographic information of patients with tuberculosis who were screened for drug resistance in Zhejiang Province between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 was collected through the national Tuberculosis Information Management System. The data were processed and analyzed using IBM SPSS 26.0 and GeoDa 1.14 software. Results: The total rifampicin resistance rate was 5.9% in 53,893 validated cases of drug resistance screening conducted in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Zhejiang Province during the study period. There was a decreasing trend in the rifampicin resistance rate in both initial and re-treated patients (P<0.001), but the rifampicin resistance rate was higher in re-treated TB patients than in TB patients receiving their initial treatment (11.4% vs 4.2%). The rate of drug resistance steadily decreased in all prefectures, and there was a significant upward trend in the use of the Xpert MTB/RIF rapid assay. An increasing trend was also identified in the rate of rifampicin and ofloxacin co-resistance (P<0.001). Conclusion: The overall rate of rifampin resistance in patients with tuberculosis in Zhejiang Province in the past five years has shown a decreasing trend, but the rate of resistance to ofloxacin was high.

This study aims to investigate whether Pluronic  F68 (P68) and dequalinium (DQA) nanocarriers can improve the ability of curcumin, n-acetylcysteine (NAC) and/or deferoxamine (DFO), to access the brain, specifically target mitochondria and protect against rotenone by evaluating their effects in a combined Transwell  hCMEC/D3 BBB and SH-SY5Y based cellular Parkinson's disease (PD) model. P68 + DQA nanoformulations enhanced the mean passage across the BBB model of curcumin, NAC and DFO by 49%, 28% and 49%, respectively (p < 0.01, n = 6). Live cell mitochondrial staining analysis showed consistent co-location of the nanocarriers within the mitochondria. P68 + DQA nanocarriers also increased the ability of curcumin and NAC, alone or combined with DFO, to protect against rotenone induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress by up to 19% and 14% (p < 0.01, n = 6), as measured by the MTT and mitochondrial hydroxyl radical assays respectively. These results indicate that the P68 + DQA nanocarriers were successful at enhancing the protective effects of curcumin, NAC and/or DFO by increasing the brain penetrance and targeted delivery of the associated bioactives to the mitochondria in this model. This study thus emphasises the potential effectiveness of this nanocarrier strategy in fully utilising the therapeutic benefit of these antioxidants and lays the foundation for further studies in more advanced models of PD.", "pmid": "36670992"}

Methods: C28/I2 chondrocytes were grown to a confluent high-density and treated either with recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6; 10-20ng/mL) or maintained in the basal state for up to 60 min. MMP gene expression was determined using RT-PCR and MMP production by semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry. The effect of IL-6 with or without Tofacitinib on activation of STAT proteins was determined from quantitative Western blots. Results: C28/I2 chondrocytes produced STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5AB which were phosphorylated (p) following treatment with rhIL-6 for 30 min. Tofacitinib (2.5nM-100nM) decreased rhIL-6-induced activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5AB as well as decreasing the expression of MMP3 and MMP13 but not MMP9, MMP1 or MMP2. In addition, Tofacitinib (50nM) reduced the number of rhIL-6-induced MMP3-, and MMP13- antibody-positive C28/I2 chondrocytes. However, Tofacitinib did decrease the number of MMP9-antibody-positive C28/I2 chondrocytes. Conclusion: Taken together, these data showed that Tofacitinib, a pan-JAK small molecule inhibitor employed for the medical therapy of rheumatoid arthritis was a potent inhibitor of rhIL-6-induced STAT phosphorylation that appeared to be coupled to the inhibition of MMP-3, -9 and -13 production by C28/I2 chondrocytes.", "pmid": "36217356"}

After early complex results with neutralizing CD40L antibodies, it turned out that lack of Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR)-binding is the crucial factor for the development of safe inhibitory antibodies targeting CD40L or CD40. Indeed, in recent years, blocking CD40 antibodies not interacting with FcgammaRs, has proven to be well tolerated in clinical studies and has shown initial clinical efficacy. Stimulation of CD40 is also of considerable therapeutic interest, especially in cancer immunotherapy. CD40 can be robustly activated by genetically engineered variants of soluble CD40L but also by anti-CD40 antibodies. However, the development of CD40L-based agonists is biotechnologically and pharmacokinetically challenging, and anti-CD40 antibodies typically display only strong agonism in complex with FcgammaRs or upon secondary crosslinking. The latter, however, typically results in poorly developable mixtures of molecule species of varying stoichiometry and FcgammaR-binding by anti-CD40 antibodies can elicit unwanted side effects such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of CD40 expressing immune cells. Here, we summarize and compare strategies to overcome the unwanted target cell-destroying activity of anti-CD40-FcgammaR complexes, especially the use of FcgammaR type-specific mutants and the FcgammaR-independent cell surface anchoring of bispecific anti-CD40 fusion proteins. Especially, we discuss the therapeutic potential of these strategies in view of the emerging evidence for the dose-limiting activities of systemic CD40 engagement.", "pmid": "36361658"}

CyTOF analysis was performed to capture gated subsets, including T cells, T regulatory (Treg) cells, B cells, innate immune cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Differential analysis was used to identify different immune cell subsets among CDa, CDin, and HC. ScRNA-seq analysis was used to verify the results of CyTOF. CD-related signaling pathways were obtained using KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. CellChat analysis was used to infer the cell communication network among immune cell subsets. Results: Compared to patients with CDin, patients with CDa had higher abundances of CD16+CD38+CD4+CXCR3+CCR6+ naive T cells, HLA-DR+CD38+IFNgamma+TNF+ effector memory (EM) T cells, HLA-DR+IFNgamma+ naive B cells, and CD14++CD11C+IFNgamma+IL1B+ monocytes.

Their expression is highly variable between individuals with little known genetic cause. Despite extensive investigation, cis-acting genetic elements that control the expression of the CYP3As remain uncharacterized. Using chromatin conformation capture (4C assays), we detected reciprocal interaction between a distal regulatory region (DRR) and the CYP3A4 promoter. The DRR colocalizes with a variety of enhancer marks and was found to promote transcription in reporter assays. CRISPR-mediated deletion of the DRR decreased expression of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7, supporting its role as a shared enhancer regulating the expression of three CYP3A genes. Using reporter gene assays, we identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs115025140 and rs776744/rs776742) that increased DRR-driven luciferase reporter expression. In a liver cohort (n = 246), rs115025140 was associated with increased expression of CYP3A4 mRNA (1.8-fold) and protein (1.6-fold) and rs776744/rs776742 was associated with 1.39-fold increased expression of CYP3A5 mRNA. The rs115025140 is unique to the African population and in a clinical cohort of African Americans taking statins for lipid control rs115025140 carriers showed a trend toward reduced statin-mediated lipid reduction. In addition, using a published cohort of Chinese patients who underwent renal transplantation taking tacrolimus, rs776744/rs776742 carriers were associated with reduced tacrolimus concentration after adjusting for CYP3A5*3.

The previous study shows that SETD2-H3K36me3 loss promotes KRAS-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis. However, little is known about its role in remodeling the TME and immune evasion. Here, it is shown that SETD2 deficiency can reprogram neutrophils to an immunosuppressive phenotype, thereby promoting immune escape during pancreatic tumor progression. By comprehensive profiling of the intratumoral immune cells, neutrophils are identified as the subset with the most significant changes upon Setd2 loss. Setd2-deficient pancreatic tumor cells directly enhance neutrophil recruitment and reprogramming, thereby inhibiting the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells to foster tumor progression. Mechanistically, it is revealed that Setd2-H3K36me3 loss leads to ectopic gain of H3K27me3 to downregulate Cxadr expression, which boosts the PI3K-AKT pathway and excessive expression of CXCL1 and GM-CSF, thereby promoting neutrophil recruitment and reprogramming toward an immunosuppressive phenotype.

Therefore, we hypothesize that melatonin could be a therapeutic target for treating potential comorbid diseases associated with this triad of psychosocial-sleep/circadian-cardiometabolic disorders. We investigated melatonin's target prediction and tractability for this triad of disorders. The melatonin's target prediction for the proposed psychosocial-sleep/circadian-cardiometabolic disorder triad was investigated using databases from Europe PMC, ChEMBL, Open Targets Genetics, Phenodigm, and PheWAS. The association scores for melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 with this disorder triad were explored for evidence of target-disease predictions. The potential of melatonin as a tractable target in managing the disorder triad was investigated using supervised machine learning to identify melatonin activities in cardiovascular, neuronal, and metabolic assays at the cell, tissue, and organism levels in a curated ChEMBL database. Target-disease visualization was done by graphs created using \"igraph\" library-based scripts and displayed using the Gephi ForceAtlas algorithm. The combined Europe PMC (data type: text mining), ChEMBL (data type: drugs), Open Targets Genetics Portal (data type: genetic associations), PhenoDigm (data type: animal models), and PheWAS (data type: genetic associations) databases yielded types and varying levels of evidence for melatonin-disease triad correlations. Of the investigated databases, 235 association scores of melatonin receptors with the targeted diseases were greater than 0.2; to classify the evidence per disease class: 37% listed psychosocial disorders, 9% sleep/circadian disorders, and 54% cardiometabolic disorders. Using supervised machine learning, 546 cardiovascular, neuronal, or metabolic experimental assays with predicted or measured melatonin activity scores were identified in the ChEMBL curated database.

Renal IRI depletes hepatic antioxidants, promotes hepatic inflammation and dysfunction through Tlr9 upregulation. There is no treatment available for liver injury during renal IRI. This study examines the hepatoprotective role of treprostinil, a prostacyclin analog, during renal IRI. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: control, sham, IRI-placebo, or IRI-treprostinil and subjected to bilateral ischemia (45 min) followed by reperfusion (1-72 h). Placebo or treprostinil (100 ng/kg/min) was administered subcutaneously via an osmotic minipump. RESULTS: Treprostinil significantly reduced peak serum creatinine, BUN, ALT and AST levels vs. IRI-placebo. Treprostinil also restored hepatic levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione, catalase, and Gclc expression to baseline, while reducing lipid peroxidation vs. IRI-placebo. Additionally, treprostinil significantly reduced elevated hepatic Tlr9, Il-1beta, Ccl2, Vcam1, and Serpine1 mRNA expression. Renal IRI increased hepatic apoptosis which was inhibited by treprostinil through reduced cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression. Treprostinil enhanced hepatic ATP concentrations and mitochondrial DNA copy number and improved mitochondrial dynamics by restoring Pgc-1alpha expression and significantly upregulating Mfn1, Mfn2, and Sirt3 levels, while reducing Drp-1 protein vs. IRI-placebo. Non-targeted semi-quantitative proteomics showed improved oxidative stress indices and ATP subunits in the IRI-treprostinil group. CONCLUSIONS: Treprostinil improved hepatic function and antioxidant levels, while suppressing the inflammatory response and alleviating Tlr9-mediated apoptotic injury during renal IRI.

Intestinal mucositis was induced by irinotecan injection (75 mg/kg, i.p., for 4 days) in Swiss mice. alpha-LA (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg, gavage) was administered daily 1 h before the injection of irinotecan. Duodenum tissues were obtained for inflammation and proliferation analysis. The outcomes: diarrhea, intestinal dysmotility, weight body loss and survival were evaluated. Compared with the control condition, irinotecan diminished (p < 0.05) intestinal villus height, caused a loss of crypt integrity and intense inflammatory cell infiltration, increased myeloperoxidase (MPO), IL-6 and IL-1beta levels and decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in duodenum segments and increased gastric retention and decreased liquid retention in the medial intestinal segment, resulting in increased intestinal transit, severe diarrhea and reduced survival (approximately 72%). Furthermore, alpha-LA (200 mg/kg) pretreatment ameliorated (p < 0.05) these irinotecan-induced effects.

We aimed to clarify the concordance between PIK3CA mutations detected in endoscopic biopsy specimens and corresponding surgically resected specimens. METHODS: We examined five hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene (E542K, E545K, E546K, H1047R, and H1047L) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of paired endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens from 181 patients undergoing curative resection for ESCC between 2000 and 2011 using a Luminex technology-based multiplex gene mutation detection kit. RESULTS: Mutation analyses were successfully performed for both endoscopic biopsy and surgically resected specimens in all the cases. A PIK3CA mutation was detected in either type of specimen in 13 cases (7.2%, 95% confidence interval: 3.9-12.0). The overall concordance rate, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 98.3% (178/181), 90.9% (10/11), and 98.8% (168/170), respectively.

Methods: The RFS prognostic model and key genes associated with PCa were established using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Cox regression from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-PRAD and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) GSE46602 datasets. The weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) was used to analyze the obtained key modules and genes, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. The phenotype and mechanism were verified in vitro. Results: A total of 18 genes were obtained by LASSO regression, and an RFS model was established and verified (TCGA, AUC: 0.774; GSE70768, AUC: 0.759). Three key genes were obtained using multivariate Cox regression. WGCNA analysis obtained the blue module closely related to the Gleason score (cor = -0.22, P = 3.3e - 05) and the unique gene glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of GPX2 was significantly higher in patients with PCa than in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (P < 0.05), but there was no significant correlation with the Gleason score (GSE46602 and GSE6919 verified), which was also verified in the GSE46602 and GSE6919 datasets. The GSEA results showed that GPX2 expression was mainly related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Wnt pathways. Additionally, GPX2 expression significantly correlated with eight kinds of immune cells. In human PCa cell lines LNCaP and 22RV1, si-GPX2 inhibited proliferation and invasion, and induced apoptosis when compared with si-NC. The protein expression of Wnt3a, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), phosphorylated (p)-GSK3beta, beta-catenin, p-beta-catenin, c-myc, cyclin D1, and vimentin decreased; the expression of E-cadherin increased; and the results for over-GPX2 were opposite to those for over-NC.

Severe, congenital disorders affecting fertility are, however, rare. While folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis are generally orchestrated via different mechanisms, some genetic anomalies can impair both female and male gametogenesis. Minichromosome maintenance complex component 9 (MCM9) is involved in DNA repair and mutations of the MCM9 gene have been previously reported in females with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). MCM9 is also an emerging cancer risk gene. We performed next-generation and Sanger sequencing of fertility and related genes and hormonal and imaging studies in a kindred whose members had POI and disordered spermatogenesis. We identified a homozygous pathogenic MCM9 variant, c.394C>T (p.Arg132*) in three sisters affected by POI due to ovarian dysgenesis and their brother who had normal pubertal development but suffered from non-obstructive azoospermia. Testicular biopsy revealed Sertoli cell-only testicular histopathology. No evidence of early onset cancer was found in the homozygotic family members, but they were all young (<30 years) at the time of the study. In the male patient the homozygous MCM9 variant led to normal pubertal development and hormonal levels but caused a Sertoli-cell-only syndrome with non-obstructive azoospermia. In the homozygous females studied, the clinical, hormonal, and gonadal phenotypes revealed ovarian dysgenesis consistent with previous reports. Active screening for potential colorectal and other cancer risks in the homozygotic MCM9 subjects has been instigated.", "pmid": "36769638"}

However, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has a complicated pathological mechanism and is an inevitable complication of coronary artery blood flow recovery. Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible alpha (GADD45A) serves a vital role in myocardial injury induced by I/R. The present study aimed to explore the role and mechanisms of GADD45A in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC)-I/R injury in vivo and in vitro. An I/R injury rat model and a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cellular model were established, and myocardial tissues were collected for GADD45A detection, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, H&E staining, and dual staining of CD31 and TUNEL. Serum was also collected for the analysis of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase in I/R rats following GADD45A silencing. Additionally, the protein expression levels of CD31, phosphorylated-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS), endothelin-1 (ET-1), JNK, p38 MAPK, STAT3 and VEGF were assessed by western blotting. The JNK and p38 MAPK activator, anisomycin, and the JAK2-STAT3 pathway inhibitor, AG490, were used to determine the involvement of JNK/p38 MAPK pathway and STAT3/VEGF pathway. GADD45A was highly expressed in I/R injury rat and cell models. GADD45A silencing reduced the ischemic area and improved myocardial pathological damage in vivo. Furthermore, the levels of CD31 and p-eNOS were increased, whereas ET-1 was decreased by GADD45A silencing in the I/R injury rats. Mechanistically, GADD45A silencing reduced JNK/p38 MAPK expression but activated STAT3/VEGF expression. GADD45A silencing inhibited H/R-induced viability reduction and apoptosis through MAPK signaling and suppressed angiogenesis via STAT3/VEGF in H/R-induced CMECs. Overall, GADD45A ameliorated apoptosis and functional injury of CMECs via the JNK/p38 MAPK and STAT3/VEGF pathways.", "pmid": "36331027"}

In animal models, sodium (salt) detection is mediated by the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel, ENaC. This ion channel works as a sodium receptor in the so-called sodium-taste cells. It is not known whether kokumi taste substances are able to affect the activity of functional ENaCs in these cells. Here, we use the patch-clamp technique to study the effect of kokumi-active tripeptides, glutathione (GSH) and gamma-glutamyl-valyl-glycine (EVG), on the ENaC-mediated membrane current in rat fungiform sodium-taste cells. GSH and EVG reduced slightly this current and the effect disappeared in the presence of amiloride, a specific ENaC blocker. No effect on membrane current was detected in other taste cells (Type II and Type III cells) that do not express functional ENaC. Our findings suggest that the enhancing effect of kokumi taste-active gamma-glutamyl peptides on salt reception is not explained by an increase in the activity of ENaC.", "pmid": "36471792"}

The growing incidence of cervical cancer is of primary concern, and has signaled the need for multiple treatment options. Despite preliminary responses to chemotherapy and/or surgical interventions, the tumors consistently relapse. Previously, natural products gained attention for their diverse bioactivities, which include however are not limited to, neuroprotective, antimicrobial and anticancer effects. The present study evaluated the anticancer activity of fucosterol against a panel of human cancer cell lines. Results indicated that fucosterol exhibited selective inhibitory activity against human HeLa cervical cancer cell line with an IC50 of 40 microM. Fucosterol also induced apoptosis in HeLa cells and prompted reactive oxygen species mediated alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential. It triggered cell cycle arrest of HeLa cells at G2/M check point and exerted inhibitory effects on cell migration. The activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (AKT)/mechanistic target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is important in cancer tumorigenesis, progression and chemotherapy resistance. The results demonstrated that fucosterol significantly inhibited the expression levels of key proteins of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.

Our previous study has revealed that Candida tropicalis (C. tropicalis) promotes colorectal tumorigenesis by enhancing immunosuppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and increasing accumulation of MDSCs, but the underlying mechanisms remain unestablished. METHODS: Bone marrow-derived MDSCs were stimulated with C. tropicalis. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed to screen the differentially expressed genes. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot were used to measure the expression of related proteins. Co-culture assay of MDSCs and CD8+ T cells was used to determine the immunosuppressive ability of MDSCs. Metabolomic analysis was conducted to detect metabolic reprogramming of MDSCs. Aerobic glycolysis of MDSCs was assessed by extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), glucose consumption and lactate production. A CAC mouse model was induced by AOM and DSS to determine the therapeutic action of TEPP-46. IHC and immunofluorescence were performed to examine the expression of PKM2, PKM2 (p-Y105) and iNOS in human CRC-infiltrated MDSCs. RESULTS: C. tropicalis facilitates immunosuppressive function of MDSCs by increasing the expression of iNOS, COX2 and NOX2, production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistically, C. tropicalis facilitates the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs through the C-type lectin receptors Dectin-3 and Syk. C. tropicalis-enhanced immunosuppressive function of MDSCs is further dependent on aerobic glycolysis. On the one hand, NO produced by MDSCs enhanced aerobic glycolysis in a positive feedback manner. On the other hand, C. tropicalis promotes p-Syk binding to PKM2, which results in PKM2 Tyr105 phosphorylation and PKM2 nuclear translocation in MDSCs. Nuclear PKM2 interacts with HIF-1alpha and subsequently upregulates the expression of HIF-1alpha target genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, GLUT1, HK2, PKM2, LDHA and PDK1, which are required for the C. tropicalis-induced aerobic glycolysis of MDSCs. Blockade of PKM2 nuclear translocation attenuates C. tropicalis-mediated colorectal tumorigenesis. The high expression of PKM2, PKM2 (p-Y105) and iNOS in CRC-infiltrated MDSCs correlates with the development of human CRC. CONCLUSION: C. tropicalis enhances immunosuppressive function of MDSCs via Syk-PKM2-HIF-1alpha-glycolysis signaling axis, which drives CRC. Therefore, we identify the Syk-PKM2-HIF-1alpha-glycolysis signaling axis as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.", "pmid": "36348389"}

This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of garcinol isolated from Garcinia dulcis fruit in LPS-activated THP-1 and Raw 264.7 macrophages. The results demonstrated that the low concentration of garcinol did not alter cell viability. Furthermore, co-incubation of garcinol with LPS inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1beta, and pro-inflammatory mediators, including iNOS and COX-2 at the mRNA and protein expression levels. Garcinol also decreased the secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, PGE2, and NO. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory effects involved an alteration in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Downregulation of pIKKalpha/beta, pIkappaBalpha, and pNF-kappaB was observed, hence reducing the translocation of pNF-kappaB from the cytosol into the nucleus, which subsequently decreased the production of pro-inflammatory molecules.

Here, we demonstrate its driving role in CLL through a B cell-restricted conditional knockin mouse model. Mutant Ikzf3 alters DNA binding specificity and target selection, leading to hyperactivation of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, overexpression of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) target genes, and development of CLL-like disease in elderly mice with a penetrance of ~40%. Human CLL carrying either IKZF3 mutation or high IKZF3 expression was associated with overexpression of BCR/NF-kappaB pathway members and reduced sensitivity to BCR signaling inhibition by ibrutinib. Our results thus highlight IKZF3 oncogenic function in CLL via transcriptional dysregulation and demonstrate that this pro-survival function can be achieved by either somatic mutation or overexpression of this CLL driver.

Therefore, we observed the distribution features and potential effects of 5-HT in the cerebrum of G93A SOD1 transgenic (TG) and wild-type (WT) mice by fluorescence immunohistochemistry, Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, as well as motor function measurements. Both 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) were mainly present in the limbic systems of the cerebrum, such as the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, cingulate, fimbria of the hippocampus, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, habenular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus nucleus, lateral hypothalamus area, dorsal raphe nucleus and piriform cortex. TPH2 and 5-HT were expressed in cell bodies in the dorsal raphe nucleus and piriform cortex, while in other regions they were distributed as filaments and clump shapes in axons. The TPH2 distribution in the cerebrum of TG was significantly lower than that in WT in preset, onset and progression stages. TPH2 expression in the fimbria of the hippocampus, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, habenular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus nucleus and lateral hypothalamus area was increased in the onset stage and decreased in the progression stage, gradually decreased in the cingulate with disease progression and significantly decreased in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb and nucleus accumbens in the onset stage in TG. The number of mammalian achaete-scute homolog-1 in the subventricular zone in TG was significantly lower than that in WT, which was correlated with the TPH2 distribution. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that TPH2, mammalian achaete-scute homolog-1 and 5-HT were mainly expressed in neurons but rarely in microglia or astrocytes in the piriform cortex. The relative fluorescence density of TPH2 in the cingulate region was negatively correlated with the disease severity. Our findings suggest that 5-HT plays a protective role in ALS, likely by regulating neural stem cells in the subventricular zone that might be involved in neuron development in the piriform cortex.Significance StatementSerotonin (5-HT) transmitters have been identified to play some roles in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but their accurate effects are not completely known.

Here, we investigate the role of Prominin-1 in lipid rafts during liver regeneration and show that expression of Prominin-1 increases after 2/3 partial hepatectomy or CCl4 injection. Hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration are attenuated in liver-specific Prominin-1 knockout mice compared to wild-type mice. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that Prominin-1 interacts with the interleukin-6 signal transducer glycoprotein 130, confining it to lipid rafts so that STAT3 signaling by IL-6 is effectively activated. The overexpression of the glycosylphosphatidylinsositol-anchored first extracellular domain of Prominin-1, which is the domain that binds to GP130, rescued the proliferation of hepatocytes and liver regeneration in liver-specific Prominin-1 knockout mice.

As the leading cause of tooth loss, periodontitis is characterized by irreversible alveolar bone loss and activated osteoclastogenic process, which might be closely related to the activated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in osteoclasts. Here, we demonstrated triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) as a key regulator of osteoclastogenesis with the regulation of intracellular ROS signals in periodontitis. In the present study, the expression of Trem2 was significantly upregulated in human alveolar bones diagnosed with chronic periodontitis, as assessed by RNA-seq. In the mice model of periodontitis, the alveolar bone resorption was impeded in the presence of the conditional knockout of Trem2 in osteoclasts. Furthermore, we identified Trem2/DAP12/Syk-dependent cascade as a vital intracellular signaling for the amplification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals in osteoclastogenesis, while the accumulation of soluble Abeta42 oligomers (Abetao) in periodontitis microenvironment further strengthened the signals and enhanced osteoclastogenesis through direct interactions with Trem2.

The target Schiff bases LnH2 were obtained as a result of the condensation of 3,5-di-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde with substituted o-aminophenols or o-aminothiophenol. These ligands with combination with 2,2'-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline, and neocuproine are able to form stable complexes upon coordination with zinc(II) ion. The molecular structures of complexes 4 H2O, 6, and 8 in crystal state were determined by means of single-crystal X-ray analysis. In the prepared complexes, the redox-active Schiff bases are in the form of doubly deprotonated dianions and act as chelating tridentate ligands. Complexes 6 and 8 possess a strongly distorted pentacoordinate geometry while 4 H2O is hexacoordinate and contains water molecule coordinated to the central zinc atom. The electrochemical properties of zinc(II) complexes were studied by the cyclic voltammetry.

We found decreased cell proliferation of a series of glioma cell lines by forced expression of DACH1. We then generated U87TR-Da glioma cells, where DACH1 expression could be activated by exposure of the cells to doxycycline. Both ex vivo cellular proliferation and in vivo growth of s.c. transplanted tumors in mice are reduced in U87TR-Da cells with DACH1 expression (U87-DACH1-high), compared with DACH1-nonexpressing U87TR-Da cells (U87-DACH1-low). U87-DACH1-low cells form spheroids with CD133 and Nestin expression in serum-free medium but U87-DACH1-high cells do not. Compared with spheroid-forming U87-DACH1-low cells, adherent U87-DACH1-high cells display lower tumorigenicity, indicating DACH1 decreases the number of tumor-initiating cells. Gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay reveal that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2/bFGF) is transcriptionally repressed by DACH1, especially in cells cultured in serum-free medium. Exogenous bFGF rescues spheroid-forming activity and tumorigenicity of the U87-DACH1-high cells, suggesting that loss of DACH1 increases the number of tumor-initiating cells through transcriptional activation of bFGF. These results illustrate that DACH1 is a distinctive tumor suppressor, which does not only suppress growth of tumor cells but also regulates bFGF-mediated tumor-initiating activity of glioma cells.", "pmid": "21750150"}

Here, we aimed to discuss the effects of FOXP4-AS1/enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)/trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3)/zinc finger CCCH-type containing 12D (ZC3H12D) axis on HCC. METHODS: The expression of FOXP4-AS1, EZH2, and ZC3H12D, and abundance of H3K27me3 in HCC tissues and cells were tested. The relationship between FOXP4-AS1 expression and prognosis of HCC patients was analyzed. The biological functions of HCC cells were detected via loss- and gain-of-function assays. The tumor weight and volume in vivo were tested. The interaction between FOXP4-AS1 and EZH2 as well as that between EZH2 and H3K27me3 was verified. RESULTS: FOXP4-AS1 and EZH2 expression and H3K27me3 abundance were enhanced while ZC3H12D expression was depressed in HCC tissues and cells. Knockdown of FOXP4-AS1 suppressed biological functions of HCC cells as well as the weight and volume of HCC transplanted tumor. Depleting ZC3H12D reversed the effect of downregulated FOXP4-AS1 on HCC cells. FOXP4-AS1 suppressed ZC3H12D expression via mediating H3K27me3 by recruitment of EZH2. CONCLUSION: The key findings of the present study demonstrate that FOXP4-AS1 suppresses ZC3H12D expression via mediating H3K27me3 by recruitment of EZH2, thus promoting the progression of HCC.", "pmid": "34545456"}

We conducted this network meta-analysis to determine the comparative efficacy and safety of three common oral JAK inhibitors including abrocitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib for moderate-to-severe AD. We first identified eligible studies from published meta-analyzes, then we searched PubMed to obtain additional studies published between February and July 2021. Clinical efficacy and safety were evaluated as primary and secondary outcome, respectively. After extracting data and assessing methodological quality, we utilized ADDIS 1.4 software to conduct pair-wise and network meta-analyzes. Ten eligible studies were included in the final analysis. Pooled results that abrocitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib obtained higher investigator global assessment (IGA), eczema area, and severity index (EASI) response, however abrocitinib and upadacitinib caused more treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) regardless of doses, compared with placebo. Network meta-analyzes revealed that upadacitinib 30 mg was superior to all regimens and upadacitinib 15 mg was better than remaining regimens except for abrocitinib 200 mg in terms of IGA and EASI response. Moreover, abrocitinib 200 mg was superior to abrocitinib 100 mg, baricitinib 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg for clinical efficacy. However, upadacitinib 30 mg caused more TEAEs. Abrocitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib were consistently effective therapies in adult and adolescent patients with AD; however, upadacitinib 30 mg may be the optimal option in short-term studies. More efforts should be done to reduce the risk of TEAEs caused by upadacitinib 30 mg.", "pmid": "35703351"}

Previous studies focused on immune-mediated processes, however, the exact pathomechanism of TIP is essentially unclear. METHODS: To model TIP in vivo, we triggered cerulein-induced experimental pancreatitis in mice receiving a daily oral dose of 1.5 mg/kg AZA. Also, freshly isolated mouse pancreatic cells were exposed to AZA ex vivo, and acinar cell viability, ductal and acinar Ca2+ signaling, ductal Cl- and HCO3- secretion, as well as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) expression were assessed using microscopy techniques. Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (RAC1) activity was measured with a G-LISA assay. Super-resolution microscopy was used to determine protein colocalization. RESULTS: We demonstrated that AZA treatment increases tissue damage in the early phase of cerulein-induced pancreatitis in vivo. Also, both per os and ex vivo AZA exposure impaired pancreatic fluid and ductal HCO3- and Cl- secretion, but did not affect acinar cells. Furthermore, ex vivo AZA exposure also inhibited RAC1 activity in ductal cells leading to decreased co-localization of CFTR and the anchor protein ezrin, resulting in impaired plasma membrane localization of CFTR. CONCLUSIONS: AZA impaired the ductal HCO3- and Cl- secretion through the inhibition of RAC1 activity leading to diminished ezrin-CFTR interaction and disturbed apical plasma membrane expression of CFTR. We report a novel direct toxic effect of AZA on pancreatic ductal cells and suggest that the restoration of ductal function might help to prevent TIP in the future.", "pmid": "36609875"}

The therapeutic effect of human carbonic anhydrase I (hCA I) in IBD remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether oral tolerization to hCA I would induce antigen-specific protection from intestinal inflammation in vivo. Severe combined immunodeficient mice received hCA I, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) orally for 7 days. Colons and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were collected 4 weeks after cell transfer. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects were investigated. The comparison between the effects of well-established drugs and hCA I oral administration was investigated. Oral administration of hCA I ameliorated colitis remarkably. hCA I reached the cecum and ameliorated colitis more effectively than mesalazine and similarly to prednisolone. Compared with PBS treatment, hCA I treatment reduced interleukin (IL)-17a, IL-6, and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORgammat) expression in the colon or MLNs; moreover, hCA I markedly reduced IL-6, IL-17, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) levels in the MLN.

This animal experiment aimed to clarify the effects of triclosan exposure on the microbiome and intestinal immune functions in healthy and ulcerative colitis models. METHODS: Balb/c mice were maintained on an AIN-93G diet containing 80ppm triclosan dissolved in polyethylene as vehicle or vehicle alone for 1 week or 4 weeks. In the end, the mice were sacrificed, blood samples and colon tissues were collected for analysis of inflammation, and fecal samples were collected for 16 S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota. To establish ulcerative colitis mice model, at the beginning of the 4th week, mice maintained on the diet with or without triclosan were treated with 2% Dextran sulfate sodium(DSS) in drinking water for 1 week. Then mice were sacrificed for analysis of colitis and gut microbiota. RESULTS: Triclosan exposure to common mice enhanced the levels of p-NF-kappab and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and decreased the Occludin in the colon. Triclosan exposure to DSS-induced mice increased the level of inflammatory cytokines, reduced the levels of Occludin, and exacerbated the degree of damage to intestinal mucosa and crypt, infiltration of inflammatory cells and atypia of glandular cells. Low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia appeared. Both in common and DSS-induced mice, triclosan exposure changed the diversity and composition of gut microbiota. Fecal samples showed higher enrichment of sulfate-reducing bacteria and Bacteroides, and less butyrate-producing bacteria. CONCLUSION: Triclosan exposure induced disturbance of gut microbiota and exaggerated experimental colitis in mice. And changes in the composition of gut microbiota were characterized by the increase of harmful bacteria, including sulfate-reducing bacteria and Bacteroides, and the reduction of protective probiotics, butyrate-producing bacteria.", "pmid": "36401221"}

The cytotoxicity effect was performed on human cancer cells, including breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, colon and ovarian cancer-cells, compared with normal cells, using the MTT assay. Cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis were detected using flow-cytometry analysis. We found that (+-)-TTPG-B exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity on aggressive breast-cancer (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) and cholangiocarcinoma (KKU-M213), with an IC50 value of 0.43 +- 0.01, 1.83 +- 0.04 and 0.01 +- 0.001 microM, respectively. Interestingly, (+-)-TTPG-A and (+-)-TTPG-B exhibited less toxicity than (+-)-kusunokinin (9.75 +- 0.39 microM) on L-929 cells (normal fibroblasts). Moreover, (+-)-TTPG-A predominated the ell-cycle arrest at the S phase, while (+-)-TTPG-B caused cell arrest at the G0/G1 phase, in the same way as (+-)-kusunokinin in KKU-M213 cells. Both (+-)-TTPG-A and (+-)-TTPG-B induced apoptosis and multi-caspase activity more than (+-)-kusunokinin. Taken together, we conclude that (+-)-TTPG-A and (+-)-TTPG-B have a strong anticancer effect on cholangiocarcinoma.

When associated with neuropilins plexin-A2 also transduces the anti-angiogenic signals of sema3B. Here we show that inhibition of plexin-A2 expression in glioblastoma derived cells that express wild type p53 such as U87MG and A172 cells, or in primary human endothelial cells, strongly inhibits cell proliferation. Inhibition of plexin-A2 expression in U87MG cells also results in strong inhibition of their tumor forming ability. Knock-out of the plexin-A2 gene in U87MG cells using CRISPR/Cas9 inhibits cell proliferation which is rescued following plexin-A2 re-expression, or expression of a truncated plexin-A2 lacking its extracellular domain. Inhibition of plexin-A2 expression results in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M stage, and is accompanied by changes in cytoskeletal organization, cell flattening, and enhanced expression of senescence associated beta-galactosidase. It is also associated with reduced AKT phosphorylation and enhanced phosphorylation of p38MAPK. We find that the pro-proliferative effects of plexin-A2 are mediated by FARP2 and FYN and by the GTPase activating (GAP) domain located in the intracellular domain of plexin-A2. Point mutations in these locations inhibit the rescue of cell proliferation upon re-expression of the mutated intracellular domain in the knock-out cells. In contrast re-expression of a plexin-A2 cDNA containing a point mutation in the semaphorin binding domain failed to inhibit the rescue. Our results suggest that plexin-A2 may represent a novel target for the development of anti-tumorigenic therapeutics.", "pmid": "36658114"}

Methods: This retrospective investigation was based on a prospectively documented database compiled at the Affiliated Kunshan Hospital of Jiangsu University between January 2015 and March 2022. In total, 2095 OP patients, who received ZOL during hospitalization, were selected for analysis. The primary endpoint was the presence (>37.3 C) or absence (<=37.3 C) of fever, quantified by the maximum body temperature, measured within 3 days of ZOL infusion. The exposure variable was the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels. Results: The OP patients with fever exhibited markedly reduced 25(OH)D content than those without fever. Upon adjusting for age, gender, order of infusion of ZOL, main diagnosis, season of blood collection, year of blood collection, calcitonin usage, and beta-C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (beta-CTX) levels, a 10 ng/mL rise in serum 25(OH)D content was correlated with a 14% (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.98, P-value = 0.0188) decrease in the odds of ZOL-induced fever. In addition, a non-linear relationship was also observed between 25(OH)D levels and fever risk, and the turning point of the adjusted smoothed curve was 35 ng/mL of serum 25(OH)D content. Conclusions: Herein, we demonstrated the independent negative relationship between serum 25(OH)D content and ZOL-induced fever risk. According to our analysis, 25(OH)D above 35 ng/mL may be more effective in preventing ZOL-induced APR. If this is confirmed, a \"vitamin D supplemental period\" is warranted prior to ZOL infusion, particularly the first ZOL infusion, to ensure appropriate 25(OH)D levels that protect against ZOL-induced fever.", "pmid": "36299453"}

Although these therapies show initially high response rates, their therapeutic benefit is limited over the lifetime of the patient due to the development of antidrug antibodies that preclude proper therapeutic benefits. As a result, patients often return to more problematic therapies such as methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine, which carry long-term side effects. Thus, there is an unmet medical need to develop alternative treatments enabling patients to regain the benefits of selectively targeting TNF functions in vivo. The protein kinase TAK1 is a critical signaling node in TNF-mediated intracellular signaling, regulating downstream NF-kappabeta activation, leading to the transcription of inflammatory cytokines. TAK1 inhibitors have been developed but have been limited in their clinical advancement due to the lack of selectivity within the human kinome and, most importantly, lack of oral bioavailability. Using a directed medicinal chemistry approach, driven by the cocrystal structure of the TAK1 inhibitor takinib, we developed HS-276, a potent (Ki = 2.5 nM) and highly selective orally bioavailable TAK1 inhibitor. Following oral administration in normal mice, HS-276 is well tolerated (MTD >100 mg/Kg), displaying >95% bioavailability with muM plasma levels. The in vitro and in vivo efficacy of HS-276 showed significant inhibition of TNF-mediated cytokine profiles, correlating with significant attenuation of arthritic-like symptoms in the CIA mouse model of inflammatory RA. Our studies reinforce the hypothesis that TAK1 can be safely targeted pharmacologically to provide an effective alternative to frontline biologic-based RA therapeutics.", "pmid": "35234444"}

Monitoring the susceptibility of mosquito populations against this new product and potential cross-resistance with current insecticides is vital for better resistance management. In this study, we assessed the resistance status of the major malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus to chlorfenapyr across Africa and explored potential cross-resistance with known pyrethroid resistance markers. Efficacy of chlorfenapyr 100 microg/ml against An. gambiae and An. funestus from five Cameroonian locations, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Uganda, and Malawi was assessed using CDC bottle assays. Synergist assays were performed with PBO (4%), DEM (8%) and DEF (0.25%) and several pyrethroid-resistant markers were genotyped in both species to assess potential cross-resistance between pyrethroids and chlorfenapyr. Resistance to chlorfenapyr was detected in An. gambiae populations from DRC (Kinshasa) (mortality rate: 64.3 +- 7.1%) Ghana (Obuasi) (65.9 +- 7.4%), Cameroon (Mangoum; 75.2 +- 7.7% and Nkolondom; 86.1 +- 7.4). In contrast, all An. funestus populations were fully susceptible. A negative association was observed between the L1014F-kdr mutation and chlorfenapyr resistance with a greater frequency of homozygote resistant mosquitoes among the dead mosquitoes after exposure compared to alive (OR 0.5; P = 0.02) whereas no association was found between GSTe2 (I114T in An. gambiae; L119F in An. funestus) and resistance to chlorfenapyr. A significant increase of mortality to chlorfenapyr 10 microg/ml was observed in An. funestus after to PBO, DEM and DEF whereas a trend for a decreased mortality was observed in An. gambiae after PBO pre-exposure. This study reveals a greater risk of chlorfenapyr resistance in An. gambiae populations than in An. funestus.

The patient, her twin sister, and her mother also presented with cerebral cavernous malformations. Based on the early onset and normocalciuria, Bartter syndrome was diagnosed first. However, mutation analysis showed that the proband is a compound heterozygote for 2 mutations in SLC12A3: a substitution of serine by leucine at amino acid position 555 (p.Ser555Leu) and a novel guanine to cytosine transition at the 5' splice site of intron 22 (c.2633+1G>C), providing the molecular diagnosis of GS. These mutations were not detected in 200 normal chromosomes and cosegregated within the family. Analysis of complementary DNA showed that the heterozygous nucleotide change c.2633+1G>C caused the appearance of 2 RNA molecules, 1 normal transcript and 1 skipping the entire exon 22 (r.2521_2634del). Supplementation with potassium and magnesium improved clinical symptoms and resulted in catch-up growth, but vision remained impaired. Three similar associations of Bartter syndrome/GS with pseudotumor cerebri were found in the literature, suggesting that electrolyte abnormalities and secondary aldosteronism may have a role in idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

This study investigated the potential for ANKH sequence variants to promote sporadic chondrocalcinosis. METHODS: ANKH variants identified by genomic sequencing were screened for association with chondrocalcinosis in 128 patients with severe sporadic chondrocalcinosis or pseudogout and in ethnically matched healthy controls. The effects of specific variants on expression of common markers were evaluated by in vitro transcription/translation. The function of these variants was studied in transfected human immortalized CH-8 articular chondrocytes. RESULTS: Sporadic chondrocalcinosis was associated with a G-to-A transition in the ANKH 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) at 4 bp upstream of the start codon (in homozygotes of the minor allele, genotype relative risk 6.0, P = 0.0006; overall genotype association P = 0.02). This -4-bp transition, as well as 2 mutations previously linked with familial and sporadic chondrocalcinosis (+14 bp C-to-T and C-terminal GAG deletion, respectively), but not the French familial chondrocalcinosis kindred 143-bp T-to-C mutation, increased reticulocyte ANKH transcription/ANKH translation in vitro. Transfection of complementary DNA for both the wild-type ANKH and the -4-bp ANKH protein variant promoted increased extracellular PPi in CH-8 cells, but unexpectedly, these ANKH mutants had divergent effects on the expression of extracellular PPi and the chondrocyte hypertrophy marker, type X collagen. CONCLUSION: A subset of sporadic chondrocalcinosis appears to be heritable via a -4-bp G-to-A ANKH 5'-UTR transition that up-regulates expression of ANKH and extracellular PPi in chondrocyte cells. Distinct ANKH mutations associated with heritable chondrocalcinosis may promote disease by divergent effects on extracellular PPi and chondrocyte hypertrophy, which is likely to mediate differences in the clinical phenotypes and severity of the disease.", "pmid": "15818664"}

The first-line treatment of COPD is the bronchodilators of beta2-agonists and antimuscarinic drugs, which can help control the airway obstruction, but the long-term use might render the drug tolerance. Bisphosphonates are widely used in osteoclast-mediated bone diseases treatment for decades. For drug repurposing, can delivery of a third generation of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, risedronate (RIS) ameliorate the progression of COPD? METHODS: COPD rats or mice models have been established through cigarette-smoking and elastase injection, and then the animals are received RIS treatment via nebulization. Lung deposition of RIS was primarily assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The respiratory parameters of airway obstruction in COPD rats and mice were documented using plethysmography method and resistance-compliance system. RESULTS: High lung deposition and bioavailability of RIS was monitored with 88.8% of RIS input dose. We found that RIS could rescue the lung function decline of airspace enlargement and mean linear intercept in the COPD lung. RIS could curb the airway obstruction by suppressing 60% of the respiratory resistance and elevating the airway's dynamic compliance, tidal volume and mid-expiratory flow. As an inhibitor of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), RIS suppresses FDPS-mediated RAS and RhoA prenylation to obstruct its membrane localization in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), leading to the inhibition of downstream ERK-MLCK and ROCK1-MLCP pathway to cause ASMCs relaxation. Additionally, RIS nebulization impeded pro-inflammatory cell accumulation, particularly macrophages infiltration in alveolar parenchyma. The NF-kappaB, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-8, and IL-6 declined in microphages following RIS nebulization. Surprisingly, nebulization of RIS could overcome the tolerance of beta2-agonists in COPD-rats by increasing the expression of beta2 receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Nebulization of RIS could alleviate airway obstruction and lung inflammation in COPD, providing a novel strategy for treating COPD patients, even those with beta2-agonists tolerance.", "pmid": "36575527"}

As a first-line drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, metformin has conflicting effects on MAT and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) differentiation. Through a series of experiments in vivo and in vitro, we found that except improving the glucose and lipid metabolism disorder in ob/ob mice, 200 mg/kg metformin increased MAT in mice tibia, and prompted osteogenic genes (RunX2, OPN, OCN) and lipogenic genes (Ppar-gamma, Cebpalpha, Scd1) expression in mice bone marrow. However, metformin promoted osteogenesis and inhibited lipogenesis of MSC in vitro, which is inconsistent with the results in vivo. Given MAT being considered the \"filler\" of the space after the apoptosis of bone marrow stroma, the effect of metformin on MSC apoptosis was examined. We discovered that metformin induces MSC apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, we speculated that the increased MAT in mice tibia may be attributed to the filling of adipose tissue after apoptosis of bone marrow stromal cells induced by metformin. The increased MAT may be involved in the regulation of metformin on glucose, lipid, and bone metabolism in diabetic mice, providing a new way to understand the metabolic regulation of metformin.

We observed 1 genome-wide significant signal (p < 5 x 10-8) for a novel locus tagged by rs2237352 in the CREB5 gene on chromosome 7 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.24). The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2237352 was imputed with a high degree of confidence (info score = 0.9847) and is common, with a minor allele frequency of 47%. After expanding the control sample to include additional unmatched non-cases, rs2237352 and another SNP in the CREB5 gene, rs12700903, were genome-wide significant. We did not detect genome-wide significant signals at loci associated with RCD in previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel association between a variant in the CREB5 gene and RCD surgery. Validation of this finding in studies with imaging data to confirm diagnoses will be an important next step. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Identification of genetic RCD susceptibility markers can guide understanding of biological processes in rotator cuff degeneration and help inform disease risk in the clinical setting.

Studying these mood disorders in animal models of mild TBI can help provide insight into possible therapies. We have previously reported that mice show increased depression, fearfulness, and anxiety, as well as visual and motor deficits, after focal cranial blast and that treatment with the cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) inverse agonist, SMM-189, reduces these deficits. We have further shown that raloxifene, which is U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved as an estrogen receptor modulator to treat osteoporosis, but also possesses CB2 inverse agonism, yields a similar benefit for visual deficits in this model of TBI. Here, we have extended our studies of raloxifene benefit and show that it similarly reverses depression, fearfulness, and anxiety after focal cranial blast TBI in mice, using standard assays of these behavioral end-points. These results indicate the potential of raloxifene in the broad rescue of deficits after mild TBI and support phase 2 efficacy testing in human clinical trials.", "pmid": "36479361"}

Transmembrane protein 68 (TMEM68) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored acyltransferase family member of unknown function. In the current study we show that overexpression of TMEM68 promotes TG accumulation and lipid droplet (LD) formation in a conserved active sites-dependent manner. Quantitative targeted lipidomic analysis showed that diacylglycerol (DG), free fatty acid (FFA) and TG levels were increased by TMEM68 expression. In addition, TMEM68 overexpression affected the levels of several glycerophospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol, as well as sterol ester contents. TMEM68 exhibited monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activities dependent on the conserved active sites in an in vitro assay. The expression of lipogenesis genes, including DGATs, fatty acid synthesis-related genes and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma was upregulated in TMEM68-overexpressing cells. These results together demonstrate for the first time that TMEM68 functions as an acyltransferase and affects lipogenic gene expression, glycerolipid metabolism and TG storage in mammalian cells.", "pmid": "36768334"}

Autophagy can be both activated and inhibited in renal carcinoma, and it plays a double-edged role in the development of renal carcinoma. In the early stage of cancer, autophagy can suppress tumors. In the late stage, autophagy contributes to the survival of tumor cells in an unfavorable environment, and some autophagy-related proteins P62, LC3B, and beclin-1 have become indicators of the prognosis of patients with renal carcinoma. Aim: To demonstrate that ursolic acid activates autophagy in renal carcinoma 786-O cells by inhibiting the hedgehog signaling pathway. Methods: The effect of ursolic acid on the viability of 786-O cells was determined by the MTT method; the effect of ursolic acid on the proliferation and migration of 786-O cells was examined by crystalline violet staining and scratch assay, respectively. For the study of autophagy, we firstly screened the time points. Western blot assay was used to detect the expression level of autophagic protein P62 at different time points of ursolic acid on 786-O. Then, the Cell MeterTM Autophagy Assay Kit was used to detect the effect of different doses of ursolic acid on the autophagic fluorescence intensity of 786-O cells; the Western blot method was used to detect the effect of different doses of ursolic acid on the expression levels of LC3II and P62 proteins in 786-O cells. Further, AdPlus-mCherry-GFP-LC3B adenovirus transfection was used to detect the effect of ursolic acid on the autophagic flow of 786-O cells; ursolic acid was combined with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) to detect the expression level of autophagy protein LC3II by Western blot. In terms of mechanism, the effect of ursolic acid on hedgehog signaling pathway-related proteins in 786-O cells was detected by Western blot. Results: Ursolic acid inhibited the activity, proliferation, and migration of 786-O cells, enhanced the fluorescence intensity of autophagosomes in 786-O cells, increased the expression level of autophagy marker protein LC3II, and inhibited the expression level of P62 in a time and dose-dependent manner; ursolic acid activated the autophagic flow in 786-O cells, which showed that ursolic acid caused the accumulation of autophagic fluorescent spots and enhanced the fluorescence intensity of autophagosomes. Ursolic acid activated the autophagic flow in 786-O cells, as evidenced by the accumulation of autophagic fluorescent spots and enhanced fluorescence intensity of autophagosomes, and the combined use of the autophagy inhibitor CQ increased the expression level of LC3II compared to ursolic acid alone; ursolic acid decreased the expression levels of PTCH1, GLI1, SMO, SHH, and c-Myc and increased the expression level of Sufu in the hedgehog signaling pathway.

Therefore, our present study aimed to investigate whether a histone deacetylase inhibitor (sodium butyrate [NaBu]) could protect the porcine liver from deoxynivalenol (DON) exposure by modulating cholesterol metabolism. Herein, we randomly divided 28 pigs into four groups, which were fed an uncontaminated basal diet, contaminated diet (4 mg DON/kg), uncontaminated diet supplemented with 0.2% NaBu or 4 mg/kg DON contaminated diet (4 mg DON/kg) supplemented with 0.2% NaBu for 28 d. RESULTS: We found that the serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were all increased in pigs exposed to DON, indicative of significant liver injury. Furthermore, the cholesterol content in the serum of DON-exposed pigs was significantly reduced, compared to the healthy Vehicle group. Transcriptome analysis of porcine liver tissues revealed that the cholesterol homeostasis pathway was highly enriched due to DON exposure. In which we validated by qRT-PCR and western blotting that the cholesterol program was markedly activated. Importantly, NaBu effectively restored parameters associated with liver injury, along with the cholesterol content and the expression of key genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Mechanistically, we performed a ChIP-seq analysis of H3K27ac and showed that NaBu strongly diminished DON-increased H3K27ac genome-wide enrichment. We further validated that the elevated H3K27ac and H3K9ac occupancies on cholesterol biosynthesis genes were both decreased by NaBu, as determined by ChIP-qPCR analysis. Notably, nuclear receptor RORgamma, a novel regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis, was found in the hyperacetylated regions. Again, a remarkable increase of RORgamma at both mRNA and protein levels in DON-exposed porcine livers was drastically reduced by NaBu. Consistent with RORgamma expression, NaBu also hindered RORgamma transcriptional binding enrichments on these activated cholesterol biosynthesis genes like HMGCR, SQLE, and DHCR24. Furthermore, we conducted an in vitro luciferase reporter assay to verify that porcine RORgamma directly bonds to the promoters of the above target genes. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results demonstrate the utility of the natural product NaBu as a potential anti-mycotoxin nutritional strategy for regulating cholesterol metabolism via RORgamma-mediated histone acetylation modification.", "pmid": "36550531"}

Ginsenosides (GS) are pharmacologically active plant products derived from ginseng that possesses lipid-regulation and antioxidation activities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible protective effects of ginsenosides (GS) on lipid homeostasis disorder and oxidative stress in mice with alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced IC and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. A comprehensive strategy via incorporating pharmacodynamics and molecular biology technology was adopted to investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of GS in ANIT-induced mice liver injury. The effects of GS on cholestasis were studied in mice that had been exposed to ANIT-induced cholestasis. The human HepG2 cell line was then used in vitro to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which GS might improve IC. The gene silencing experiment and liver-specific sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) knockout (SIRT1LKO) mice were used to further elucidate the mechanisms. The general physical indicators were assessed, and biological samples were collected for serum biochemical indexes, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress-related indicators. Quantitative PCR and H&E staining were used for molecular and pathological analysis. The altered expression levels of key pathway proteins (Sirt1, p-AMPK, Nrf2) were validated by Western blotting. By modulating the AMPK protein expression, GS decreased hepatic lipogenesis, and increased fatty acid beta-oxidation and lipoprotein lipolysis, thereby improving lipid homeostasis in IC mice. Furthermore, GS reduced ANIT-triggered oxidative damage by enhancing Nrf2 and its downstream target levels. Notably, the protective results of GS were eliminated by SIRT1 shRNA in vitro and SIRT1LKO mice in vivo. GS can restore the balance of the lipid metabolism and redox in the livers of ANIT-induced IC models via the SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, thus exerting a protective effect against ANIT-induced cholestatic liver injury.", "pmid": "36235592"}

Long-term systemic administration of SMV has been shown to result in increased bone mineral density. Alendronate (ALN) is known to inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and has osteostimulative properties. Aim: To compare percentile changes in gain in clinical attachment level and reduction of pocket depth, and to radiographically evaluate osseous defect fill with subgingival local drug delivery of 1.2% SMV gel and 1% ALN gel. Materials and Methods: A split-mouth study was conducted with 40 infrabony defects from 20 patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis. The sites were assigned as test site 1 (SMV gel) or test site 2 (ALN gel). After phase I therapy, a single application of SMV gel or ALN gel was done into periodontal pockets. Clinical periodontal parameters and percentage of bone fill were evaluated at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Results: There was a statistically significant reduction in pocket depth, plaque index, and bleeding index scores, gain in Clinical attachment level (CAL) and bone defect fill from baseline to 6 months at both sites. On comparison between the groups, test site 2 showed significant improvement in clinical attachment level than in test site 1 at 6-month follow-up. Test site 2 showed more percentage bone fill than test site 1. Conclusion: Usage of both SMV and ALN gels in periodontal intra bony defects can lead to significant improvements in clinical and radiographic parameters; however, ALN showed better osseous defect fill.", "pmid": "36582946"}

Ruxolitinib, a JAK 1 and JAK 2 inhibitor, showed superiority over best available therapy in a phase 2 study in patients with polycythaemia vera who were resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. We aimed to compare the long-term safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib with best available therapy in patients with polycythaemia vera who were resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. METHODS: We report the 5-year results for a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (RESPONSE) that enrolled patients at 109 sites across North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients (18 years or older) with polycythaemia vera who were resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either ruxolitinib or best available therapy. Patients randomly assigned to the ruxolitinib group received the drug orally at a starting dose of 10 mg twice a day. Single-agent best available therapy comprised hydroxyurea, interferon or pegylated interferon, pipobroman, anagrelide, approved immunomodulators, or observation without pharmacological treatment. The primary endpoint, composite response (patients who achieved both haematocrit control without phlebotomy and 35% or more reduction from baseline in spleen volume) at 32 weeeks was previously reported. Patients receiving best available therapy could cross over to ruxolitinib after week 32. We assessed the durability of primary composite response, complete haematological remission, overall clinicohaematological response, overall survival, patient-reported outcomes, and safety after 5-years of follow-up. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01243944. FINDINGS: We enrolled patients between Oct 27, 2010, and Feb 13, 2013, and the study concluded on Feb 9, 2018. Of 342 individuals screened for eligibility, 222 patients were randomly assigned to receive ruxolitinib (n=110, 50%) or best available therapy (n=112, 50%). The median time since polycythaemia vera diagnosis was 8 2 years (IQR 3 9-12 3) in the ruxolitinib group and 9 3 years (4 9-13 8) in the best available therapy group. 98 (88%) of 112 patients initially randomly assigned to best available therapy crossed over to receive ruxolitinib and no patient remained on best available therapy after 80 weeks of study. Among 25 primary responders in the ruxolitinib group, six had progressed at the time of final analysis. At 5 years, the probability of maintaining primary composite response was 74% (95% CI 51-88). The probability of maintaining complete haematological remission was 55% (95% CI 32-73) and the probability of maintaining overall clinicohaematological responses was 67% (54-77). In the intention-to-treat analysis not accounting for crossover, the probability of survival at 5 years was 91 9% (84 4-95 9) with ruxolitinib therapy and 91 0% (82 8-95 4) with best available therapy. Anaemia was the most common adverse event in patients receiving ruxolitinib (rates per 100 patient-years of exposure were 8 9 for ruxolitinib and 8 8 for the crossover population), though most anaemia events were mild to moderate in severity (grade 1 or 2 anaemia rates per 100 patient-years of exposure were 8 0 for ruxolitinib and 8 2 for the crossover population). Non-haematological adverse events were generally lower with long-term ruxolitinib treatment than with best available therapy. Thromboembolic events were lower in the ruxolitinib group than the best available therapy group. There were two on-treatment deaths in the ruxolitinib group. One of these deaths was due to gastric adenocarcinoma, which was assessed by the investigator as related to ruxolitinib treatment. INTERPRETATION: We showed that ruxolitinib is a safe and effective long-term treatment option for patients with polycythaemia vera who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. Taken together, ruxolitinib treatment offers the first widely approved therapeutic alternative for this post-hydroxyurea patient population.

The elevated IQGAP3 expression in cancer and its association with metastasis suggest a fundamental role for IQGAP3 in proliferating cancer stem cells. What causes IQGAP3 upregulation in cancer is unclear. Here, we show that IGF2BP1 and IQGAP3 expression levels are highest in the blastocyst, with both decreasing during adulthood. This suggests that IQGAP3, like IGF2BP1, is an early developmental gene that is aberrantly upregulated upon re-expression of IGF2BP1 during carcinogenesis. IGF2BP1 binds and stabilizes m6A-modified IQGAP3 transcripts. Downstream targets of IGF2BP1, namely SRF and FOXM1, also upregulate IQGAP3 expression.

O-GalNAcylation is thought to play roles in protein folding, stability, trafficking and protein interactions, and identification of the site-specific O-GalNAc glycoproteome is a crucial step toward understanding the biological significance of the modification. However, lack of suitable methodology, absence of consensus sequon of O-GalNAcylation sites and complex O-GalNAc glycan structures pose analytical challenges. We recently developed a mass spectrometry-based method called extraction of O-linked glycopeptides (EXoO) that enables large-scale mapping of site-specific mucin-type O-GalNAcylation sites. Here we provide a detailed protocol for EXoO, which includes seven stages of: (1) extraction and proteolytic digestion of proteins to peptides, (2) sequential guanidination and de-salting of peptides, (3) enrichment of glycopeptides, (4) solid-phase peptide conjugation and release of O-GalNAc glycopeptides using the OpeRATOR protease, (5) liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis of O-GalNAc glycopeptides, (6) identification of O-GalNAc glycopeptides by database search and (7) quantification of O-GalNAc glycopeptides.

We are curious about its implications in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC), a malignant tumor with a high incidence rate and high mortality. METHOD: Lentiviral stable transfections of SLFN5-specific shRNA for knockdown and SLFN5 full-length coding sequence for overexpression were performed in LUAC cell for proliferation analysis in vitro and in vivo in nude mice. Clinical LUAC samples were collected for immunohistochemical analysis of SLFN5 protein levels. RESULTS: We found that knockdown of endogenous SLFN5 upregulates cancer cell proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis. Besides, SLFN5 inhibition on proliferation was also observed in a nude mouse xenograft model. In contrast, overexpression of exogenous SLFN5 inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and promoted apoptosis. As to the signaling pathway, we found phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN) was positively regulated by SLFN5, while its downstream signaling pathway AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was inhibited. Moreover, compared with adjacent normal tissues, SLFN5 protein levels were markedly decreased in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. In conclusion, these suggest that human SLFN5 plays inhibitory roles in LUAC progression through the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, providing a potential target for developing drugs for lung cancer therapy in the future.", "pmid": "33860045"}

Herein, we designed a novel STING agonist, designated as HB3089 that exhibits robust and durable anti-tumor activity in tumor models across various cancer types. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that HB3089-bound human STING has structural changes similar to that of the STING mutant V147L, a constitutively activated mutant identified in patients with STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). Both structures highlight the conformational changes of the transmembrane domain (TMD), but without the 180 -rotation of the ligand binding domain (LBD) previously shown to be required for STING activation. Further structure-based functional analysis confirmed a new STING activation mode shared by the agonist and the SAVI-related mutation, in which the connector linking the LBD and the TMD senses the activation signal and controls the conformational changes of the LBD and the TMD for STING activation.

Induction of fetal gamma-globin is an established therapeutic strategy. Recently, epigenetic modulators, including G9a inhibitors, have been proposed as therapeutic agents.

Here we describe a signaling complex involving the small GTPase Cdc42 and Dock7, a Cdc42/Rac GEF and unique Cdc42-effector, that has a previously unappreciated role in regulating AKT, mTOR, and other mTOR signaling and regulatory partners including the TSC1/TCS2 complex and S6K during serum starvation. Dock7 is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancers and is essential for the malignant properties in nutrient-deprived growth conditions of several cancer cell lines. We find that Dock7 interacts with phosphorylated AKT to maintain a low, but critical activation of a rapamycin-sensitive and Raptor-independent mTORC1-like activity required for survival during nutrient stress. Following the knock-out of Dock7 from cancer cells, interactions between AKT and the phosphatase PHLPP increased while phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 decreased, suggesting Dock7 protects AKT from dephosphorylation. The DHR1 domain of Dock7, previously of unknown function, is responsible for maintaining AKT Ser473 phosphorylation during serum starvation through an interaction requiring its C2-like motif. Together, these findings indicate that Dock7 protects and maintains the phosphorylation of AKT to sustain a tonic mTOR/S6K activity in cancer cells necessary for their resistance to anoikis and to prevent them from undergoing apoptosis during stressful conditions.", "pmid": "36711811"}

The Z-axial view of noncancerous MDCK-II and PZ-HPV-7 cell-cell junctions resolved beta-catenin and p120ctn localizations to TJs and AJs, with p120ctn apical to beta-catenin and colocalizing with TJ protein claudin-7.

ACE2 expression and the production of intracellular porphyrins following ALA administration were carried out. We observed the reduction of ACE2 expression and intracellular porphyrins following ALA administration. ALA suppressed the ACE2 expression in host cells which might prevent binding of SARS-CoV-2 to host cells. Co-administration of ALA and sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) resulted in a further decrease in ACE2 expression and increase in intracellular heme level. This suggests that the suppression of ACE2 expression by ALA might occur through heme production. We found that the inhibition of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which is involved in heme degradation, also resulted in decrease in ACE2 expression, suggesting a potential role of HO-1 in suppressing ACE2 as well. In conclusion, we speculate that ALA, together with SFC administration, might serve as a potential therapeutic approach in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity through suppression of ACE2 expression.", "pmid": "36757984"}

In previous studies, we constructed a CAR T cell (CD105 CAR T cell) and observed significant antitumor activity. In this study, we optimized the structure of CD105 CAR to increase PD-1 antibody secretion function (CD105 x PD-1 CAR T cells). Methods: we tested whether Increased PD-1 antibody secretion with CAR T cells targeted CD105 could promote in vitro proliferation, proinflammatory cytokine production and cytotoxicity,or not. For the in vivo experiments, we constructed a subcutaneously transplanted tumor model and placed it in NOD/SCID mice to verify the anti-tumor effect of this therapy. Results: Our data showed that the PD-1 antibody secreted by CD105 x PD-1 CAR T cells could specifically bind to the PD-1 receptor of T cells then blocked the PD-1/PD-L-1 signaling pathway, thus enhancing the activation and proliferation of CAR T cells. After incubation of CD105 x PD-1 CAR T cells with HepG2 as a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line expressing CD105, the results showed that CD105 x PD-1 CAR T cells increased the expression levels of CD69 and CD62L, enhanced the proliferation capacity of CAR T cells, and secreted more IL-2, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma than CD105 CAR T cells. Conclusion: These data showed that CD105 x PD-1 CAR T cells was specifically killing tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Our findings may therefore provide a promising new strategy for the improvement of CAR T therapy for solid tumors.", "pmid": "36685461"}

In this study, we first used the proteomics approach to obtain the differentially expressed proteins in the liver between naive control and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) induced depressed mice. We have identified the upregulation of iron binding protein transferrin (TF) in the liver, the peripheral blood, and the brain in CSDS-exposed mice. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database from various mouse models of depression revealed the significantly upregulated transcripts of TF and its receptor TfR1 in multiple brain regions in depressed mice. We also used the recombinant TF administration via the tail vein to detect its permeability through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We demonstrated the permeability of peripheral TF into the brain through the BBB. Together, these results identified the elevated expression of TF and its receptor TfR1 in both peripheral liver and the central brain in CSDS-induced depressed mice, and peripheral administration of TF can be transported into the brain through the BBB. Therefore, our data provide a compelling information for understanding the potential role and mechanisms of the cross-talk between the liver and the brain in stress-induced depression.", "pmid": "36291201"}

Recently, we observed that OTA induces liver damage preferentially to the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-expressing pericentral lobular zone, similar to hepatotoxic substances known to be metabolically toxified by CYP, such as acetaminophen or carbon tetrachloride. To investigate whether CYP influences OTA toxicity, we used a single dose of OTA (7.5 mg/kg; intravenous) with and without pre-treatment with the pan CYP-inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) 2 h before OTA administration. Blood, urine, as well as liver and kidney tissue samples were collected 24 h after OTA administration for biochemical and histopathological analyses. Inhibition of CYPs by ABT strongly increased the nephro- and hepatotoxicity of OTA. The urinary kidney damage biomarkers kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were increased > 126-fold and > 20-fold, respectively, in mice treated with ABT and OTA compared to those receiving OTA alone. The blood biomarkers of liver damage, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) both increased > 21- and 30-fold, respectively, when OTA was administered to ABT pre-treated mice compared to the effect of OTA alone. Histological analysis of the liver revealed a pericentral lobular damage induced by OTA despite CYP-inhibition by ABT. Administration of ABT alone caused no hepato- or nephrotoxicity. Overall, the results presented are compatible with a scenario where CYPs mediate the detoxification of OTA, yet the mechanisms responsible for the pericental liver damage pattern still remain to be elucidated.", "pmid": "36227364"}

There is debate as to whether the APOE gene accounts for all genetic variation of the APOE locus. Another question which remains is whether APOE-epsilon4 carriers have other genetic factors influencing the progression of amyloid positive individuals to AD. We conducted a genome-wide association study in a sample of 5,390 APOE-epsilon4 homozygous (epsilon4epsilon4) individuals (288 cases and 5102 controls) aged 65 or over in the UK Biobank. We found no significant associations of SNPs in the APOE locus with AD in the sample of epsilon4epsilon4 individuals. However, we identified a novel genome-wide significant locus associated to AD, mapping to DAB1 (rs112437613, OR = 2.28, CI = 1.73-3.01, p = 5.4 x 10-9). This identification of DAB1 led us to investigate other components of the DAB1-RELN pathway for association. Analysis of the DAB1-RELN pathway indicated that the pathway itself was associated with AD, therefore suggesting an epistatic interaction between the APOE locus and the DAB1-RELN pathway.", "pmid": "35977442"}

Before this study, a gE/TK-gene-deleted virus (PRV DeltagE/TK) was constructed from PRV QYY2012 variant through homologous recombination and Cre/LoxP system. Here, PRV DeltagE/TK/US3 strain was generated by deleting US3 gene based on PRV DeltagE/TK strain using the same method. The growth characteristics of PRV DeltagE/TK/US3 were analogous to that of PRV DeltagE/TK. Moreover, the deletion of US3 gene could promote apoptosis, upregulate the level of swine leukocyte antigen class I molecule (SLA-I) in vitro, and relieve inflammatory response in inoculated BALB/c mice. Subsequently, the safety and immunogenicity of PRV DeltagE/TK/US3 was evaluated as a vaccine candidate in mice. The results revealed that PRV DeltagE/TK/US3 was safe for mice, and mice vaccinated with PRV DeltagE/TK/US3 could induce a higher level of PRV-specific neutralizing antibodies and cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-4, also higher level of CD8+ CD69+ Tissue-Resident Memory T cells (TRM).

In this Austria-based multicenter study, we aimed to explore the real-world outcomes of bevacizumab use in front-line treatment of ovarian cancer, including patients with comorbidities and poor performance status. PATIENTS: This study is an open label single arm multicenter noninterventional trial and included patients with newly diagnosed advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and were candidates for receiving bevacizumab according to the product label. Data collection started in the third quarter of 2012 and ended in the third quarter of 2018. RESULTS: In this study 50 patients were included and 575 adverse events were reported for 90% of the patients. The majority of the adverse events were mild (47%) or moderate (37%). The most common adverse events were hypertension (60%), anemia (48%), leukopenia (42%), thrombocytopenia (36%), neutropenia (36%) and proteinuria (26%). A relation to bevacizumab was documented only for 10.3% of all adverse events. In almost 50% of all adverse events, no intervention was needed and bevacizumab treatment had to be interrupted only in 3.3% of all adverse events. The median progression-free survival was 1.3 years (95% CI 1.1-1.8). CONCLUSION: The routine use of front-line bevacizumab for advanced ovarian cancer is associated with high efficacy comparable with that obtained in randomized phase III clinical trials; however, hypertension and proteinuria were reported significantly more often in our Austria-based real-world population.", "pmid": "35146539"}

MPS are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous but are traditionally divided into prenatally lethal and nonlethal (Escobar) types. Previously, we and others reported that recessive mutations in the embryonal acetylcholine receptor g subunit (CHRNG) can cause both lethal and nonlethal MPS, thus demonstrating that pterygia resulted from fetal akinesia. We hypothesized that mutations in acetylcholine receptor-related genes might also result in a MPS/fetal akinesia phenotype and so we analyzed 15 cases of lethal MPS/fetal akinesia without CHRNG mutations for mutations in the CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, and rapsyn (RAPSN) genes. No CHRNA1, CHRNB1, or CHRND mutations were detected, but a homozygous RAPSN frameshift mutation, c.1177-1178delAA, was identified in a family with three children affected with lethal fetal akinesia sequence. Previously, RAPSN mutations have been reported in congenital myasthenia. Functional studies were consistent with the hypothesis that whereas incomplete loss of rapsyn function may cause congenital myasthenia, more severe loss of function can result in a lethal fetal akinesia phenotype.", "pmid": "18179903"}

Methods: Blood glucose, blood lipid, oxidative stress response and inflammatory cytokines were examined by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and ELISA assay. HE and Oil Red O staining were used to estimate the extent of hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR were used to further investigate the potential mechanism. The effects of canagliflozin on autophagy were detected using transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting. The endothelial function-related markers were determined by qRT-PCR. Results: Canagliflozin notably alleviated the elevation in blood glucose and insulin resistance in western diet-fed ApoE-/- mice. In ApoE-/-+Cana group, ApoE-/- mice had lower levels of TG, TC, LDL-C, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and MCP-1. HE and Oil Red O staining presented that canagliflozin restrained the atherosclerotic plaque development and lipid accumulation. RNA-seq showed that 87 DEGs were relevant to improvement of hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis by canagliflozin. Among them, CPS1, ASS1, ASL, ARG1, MATLA, GLS2, GOT1, SREBP1, Plin5, Retreg1, and C/EBPbeta were verified. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that DEGs were mainly involved in amino acid metabolism. Besides, we observed that canagliflozin reduced the contents of aspartic acid and citrulline in liver. Western blotting showed that ASS1 and p-AMPK/AMPK was remarkably elevated after administration of canagliflozin. Correspondingly, canagliflozin down-regulated SREBP1, FAS, ACC1, HMGCR, p-mTOR/m-TOR, p-ULK1/ULK1 and p62, but up-regulated CPT1, Beclin 1 and LC3 II/LC3I. TEM showed that canagliflozin reduced the number of lipid droplets and increased the autophagosomes. Moreover, we found that canagliflozin elevated the aortic endothelial function-associated markers including ASS1, ASL and eNOS. Conclusion: Canagliflozin may attenuate hepatic steatosis by improving lipid metabolism, enhancing autophagy, and reducing inflammatory response through ASS1/AMPK pathway.

At present, there are few reports on the efficacy and safety of alectinib in Chinese population. Moreover, biomarkers reflecting prognosis and efficacy are exceedingly needed. This study assessed the efficacy of alectinib in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and analyzed the prognostic factors. Methods: Patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who were confirmed by histopathology or cytology at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between October 2018 and October 2021 were enrolled. All patients were treated with alectinib. The clinical characteristics and circulating tumor biomarkers before and after treatment were collected. Kaplan-Meier test was used to calculate the progression-free survival (PFS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to explore the influencing factors on PFS. Incidence of adverse events was observed. Results: Twenty patients progressed after first-line treatment (n=59) with alectinib, and 21 patients progressed following second-line treatment (n=36) with alectinib. The median PFS of first-line treatment patients was not achieved, and the median PFS of patients undergoing second-line treatment was 15.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.00-32.23]. The most common adverse reactions were liver dysfunction (37.50%), anemia (37.50%), and constipation (20.83%). The incidence of grade III and above adverse reactions was 6.25%. Univariate analysis showed that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR; hazard ratio (HR) =0.424, P=0.005] carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; HR =0.482, P=0.029), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; HR =0.327, P<0.001), carbohydrate antigen (CA)199 (HR =0.313, P=0.002), and circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA; HR =0.229, P=0.008) concentration levels were associated with PFS, and multivariate analysis showed that NLR (HR =3.058, P=0.034) was independent prognostic factor. After three months of treatment, CEA, CA199, NLR, and LDH, could further predict the prognosis of alectinib treatment. Conclusions: The efficacy and safety of alectinib as a first-line or second-line treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC in keeping with published prospective studies.

Although, diazepam clears these seizures, the risk of central respiratory depression cannot be overlooked. Henceforth, three adsorbing composites were examined in a tramadol acute intoxication mouse model. METHODS: Calcium Silicate (Wollastonite) either non-doped or wet doped with iron oxide (3%Fe2O3) or zinc oxide (30% ZnO) were prepared. The composites' adsorption capacity for tramadol was determined in vitro. Tramadol intoxication was induced in Swiss albino mice by a parenteral dose of 120 mg/kg. Proposed treatments were administered within 1 min at 5 increasing doses, i.p. The next 30 min, seizures were monitored as an intoxication symptom. Plasma tramadol concentration was recorded after two hours of administration. RESULTS: The 3% Fe2O3-containing composite (CSFe3), was found to be composed of mainly wollastonite with very little alpha-hematite. On the other hand, hardystonite and wellimite were developed in the 30%ZnO-containing composite (CSZn3). Micro-round and irregular nano-sized microstructures were established (The particle size of CS was 56 nm, CSFe3 was 49 nm, and CSZn3 was 42 nm). The CSZn3 adsorption capacity reached 1497 mg of tramadol for each gram. Tramadol concentration was reduced in plasma and seizures were inhibited after its administration to mice at three doses. CONCLUSION: The calcium silicate composite doped with ZnO presented a good resolution of tramadol-induced seizures accompanied by detoxification of blood, indicating its potential for application in such cases.

Accumulating evidence suggests that metformin may improve IR through regulating gut microbiota and bile acids. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our metabolomic analysis showed that metformin significantly increased the accumulation of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) in intestine and liver from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced IR mice. TUDCA also alleviated IR, and reduced oxidative stress and intestinal inflammation in ob/ob mice. TUDCA blocked KEAP1 to bind with Nrf2, resulting in Nrf2 translocation into nuclear and initiating the transcription of antioxidant genes, which eventually reduced intracellular ROS accumulation and improved insulin signaling. Analysis of gut microbiota further revealed that metformin reduced the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, which produces bile salt hydrolase (BSH). The reduction in BSH was probably crucial for the accumulation of TUDCA. Metformin also increased the proportion of Akkermanisia muciniphlia in gut microbiota of ob/ob mice via TUDCA. These beneficial effects of metformin in remodeling gut microbiota, reducing oxidative stress and improving insulin sensitivity were partly due to the accumulation of TUDCA, suggesting that TUDCA may be a potential therapy for metabolic syndrome.", "pmid": "36148770"}

Preclinical data suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase inhibitors (ATRi) are synergistic. CAPRI (NCT03462342) is an investigator-initiated study of olaparib plus ceralasertib in recurrent HGSOC. Herein, we present results from the platinum-resistant cohort. METHODS: A Simon 2-stage design was utilized. Platinum-resistant HGSOC patients received ceralasertib 160 mg orally daily, days 1-7 and olaparib 300 mg orally twice daily, days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle until toxicity or progression. Primary endpoints were toxicity and efficacy including objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST. Secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The null hypothesis (<=5% ORR) would be rejected if there were >= 1 responses in 12 patients. RESULTS: Fourteen PARPi-naive patients were evaluable for toxicity; 12 were evaluable for response. Three had BRCA1 mutations (1 germline, 2 somatic). Adverse events possibly related to treatment were primarily grade (G) 1/2. G3 toxicities included nausea (14.3%), fatigue (7.1%), anorexia (7.1%), and anemia (7.1%). No objective responses occurred. Best response was stable disease in 9 patients and progressive disease in three. Five patients had a >= 20% to <30% reduction in disease burden, including 3 with BRCA1 mutations. Three of 11 patients (27%; 2 with BRCA1 mutations) evaluable by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup criteria had >50% CA-125 decline, including 2 with CA-125 normalization.

Soil column consolidation tests, diffusion tests, and breakdown tests were conducted to study migration of organic pollutants in soil columns. The parameter sensitivity of pollutant transport in the cut-off wall was analysed by numerical simulation. The sodium bentonite mixed with 10% CTMAB bentonite and kaolin-CTMAB bentonite showed the greatest impermeability: with a consolidation pressure of 200 kPa, the permeability coefficients were 1.03 x 10-8 m/s and 3.49 x 10-9 m/s, respectively. The quantity of phenol adsorbed on sodium bentonite-CTMAB bentonite increased with increasing water head height. The kaolin-CTMAB bentonite column showed the best rhodamine B adsorption performance, and the adsorption rate reached 98.9% on day 67.

When PCa metastasizes to the bone, the new microenvironment can induce the epigenome reprogramming and stemness remodeling of cancer cells, thereby increasing the adaptability of cancer cells to the bone microenvironment, and this even leads to the occurrence of secondary tumor metastasis. Our group has previously found that RNA binding motif 3 (RBM3) affects the stem cell-like properties of PCa by interfering with alternative splicing of CD44. However, whether RBM3, as a stress-response protein, can resist microenvironmental remodeling of PCa particularly in bone metastasis remains unknown. By co-culturing PCa cells with osteoblasts to mimic PCa bone metastases, we found that RBM3 upregulates the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation on the mRNA of catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1) in a manner dependent on methyltransferase 3 (METTL3), an N6-adenosine-methyltransferase complex catalytic subunit. Consequently, this modification results in a decreased stability of CTNNB1 mRNA and a followed inactivation of Wnt signaling, which ultimately inhibits the stemness remodeling of PCa cells by osteoblasts. Thus, the present study may extend our understanding of the inhibitory role of RBM3 on particularly bone metastasis of PCa.", "pmid": "36750551"}

However, the role of GUCA1B gene mutations in inherited retinal disease has been controversial. We therefore performed a mutation analysis of the GUCA1B gene in a clinically well characterized group of patients of European and North-American geographical origin with autosomal dominantly inherited cone dystrophy and cone rod dystrophy. Material and Methods: Twenty-four unrelated patients diagnosed with cone dystrophy or cone rod dystrophy according to standard diagnostic criteria and a family history consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance were included in the study. Mutation analysis of all coding exons of the GUCA1B gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and subsequent DNA sequencing. Results: Three different sequence variants, c.-17T>C, c.171T>C, c.465G>T were identified. The sequence variant c.465G>T encodes a conservative amino acid substitution, p.Glu155Asp, located in EF-hand 4, the calcium binding site of GCAP2 protein. All sequence variants were previously reported in healthy subjects.

Specific microRNAs have been suggested to affect the activation of HSCs via various signalling pathways including TGF-beta/smads and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways. Dasatinib is a multitarget inhibitor of many tyrosine kinases has recently studied for its anti-fibrotic effects in a variety of fibrous diseases. This study investigated the role of modulation of miRNA-378 and miRNA-17 in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis through altering Wnt/beta-catenin and TGF-beta/smads pathways and evaluated the beneficial effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, in thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis model in mice. Treatment with dasatinib down-regulated miRNA-17 expression, leading to the restoration of WiF-1 and smad-7 which cause the inhibition of both Wnt/beta-catenin and TGF-beta/smads signalling. In addition, it upregulated miRNA-378 leading to the decrease of Wnt-10 which contributes to the suppression of activated HSCs.", "pmid": "34894966"}

Here, we estimated the rate of mutation accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and investigated the repeatability of its evolution when facing a new cell type but no immune or drug pressures. Methodology: We performed experimental evolution with two strains of SARS-CoV-2, one carrying the originally described spike protein (CoV-2-D) and another carrying the D614G mutation that has spread worldwide (CoV-2-G). After 15 passages in Vero cells and whole genome sequencing, we characterized the spectrum and rate of the emerging mutations and looked for evidences of selection across the genomes of both strains. Results: From the frequencies of the mutations accumulated, and excluding the genes with signals of selection, we estimate a spontaneous mutation rate of 1.3 x 10 -6 +- 0.2 x 10-6 per-base per-infection cycle (mean across both lineages of SARS-CoV-2 +- 2SEM). We further show that mutation accumulation is larger in the CoV-2-D lineage and heterogeneous along the genome, consistent with the action of positive selection on the spike protein, which accumulated five times more mutations than the corresponding genomic average. We also observe the emergence of mutators in the CoV-2-G background, likely linked to mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and/or in the error-correcting exonuclease protein. Conclusions and implications: These results provide valuable information on how spontaneous mutations emerge in SARS-CoV-2 and on how selection can shape its genome toward adaptation to new environments. Lay Summary: Each time a virus replicates inside a cell, errors (mutations) occur. Here, via laboratory propagation in cells originally isolated from the kidney epithelium of African green monkeys, we estimated the rate at which the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates-an important parameter for understanding how it can evolve within and across humans. We also confirm the potential of its Spike protein to adapt to a new environment and report the emergence of mutators-viral populations where mutations occur at a significantly faster rate.", "pmid": "35419205"}

Their toxicities might be reduced if CAR T-cell activity was regulatable rather than constitutive. To test this, we compared the efficacies and morbidities of constitutively active (conventional) and regulatable (switchable) CAR (sCAR) T-cells specific for human CD19 (huCD19) in an immune-competent huCD19+ transgenic mouse model.Conventional CAR (CAR19) and sCAR T-cells were generated by retrovirally transducing C57BL/6 (B6) congenic T-cells with constructs encoding antibody-derived single chain Fv (sFv) fragments specific for huCD19 or a peptide neoepitope (PNE), respectively. Transduced T-cells were adoptively transferred into huCD19 transgenic hemizygous (huCD19Tg/0 ) B6 mice; healthy B-cells in these mice expressed huCD19Tg Prior to transfer, recipients were treated with a lymphodepleting dose of cyclophosphamide to enhance T-cell engraftment. In tumor therapy experiments, CAR19 or sCAR T-cells were adoptively transferred into huCD19Tg/0 mice bearing a syngeneic B-cell lymphoma engineered to express huCD19. To regulate sCAR T cell function, a switch protein was generated that contained the sCAR-specific PNE genetically fused to an anti-huCD19 Fab fragment. Recipients of sCAR T-cells were injected with the switch to link sCAR effector with huCD19+ target cells. Mice were monitored for survival, tumor burden (where appropriate), morbidity (as measured by weight loss and clinical scores), and peripheral blood lymphocyte frequency.CAR19 and sCAR T-cells functioned comparably regarding in vivo expansion and B-cell depletion. However, sCAR T-cells were better tolerated as evidenced by the recipients' enhanced survival, reduced weight loss, and improved clinical scores. Discontinuing switch administration allowed healthy B-cell frequencies to return to pretreatment levels.In our mouse model, sCAR T-cells killed huCD19+ healthy and malignant B-cells and were better tolerated than CAR19 cells. Our data suggest sCAR might be clinically superior to the current FDA-approved therapies for B-cell lymphomas due to the reduced acute and chronic morbidities and mortality, lower incidence and severity of side effects, and B-cell reconstitution on cessation of switch administration.", "pmid": "36521930"}

Transcriptomic analysis showed that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway was up-regulated in human RPE cells upon treatment with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2, a multifunctional cytokine associated with clinical PVR. Stimulation of human RPE cells with TGF-beta2 induced expression of p110delta (the catalytic subunit of PI3Kdelta) and activation of NFkappaB/p65. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated depletion of p110delta or NFkappaB/p65 suppressed TGF-beta2-induced fibronectin expression and activation of Akt as well as migration of these cells. Intriguingly, abrogating expression of NFkappaB/p65 also blocked TGF-beta2-induced expression of p110delta, and luciferase reporter assay indicated that TGF-beta2 induced NFkappaB/p65 binding to the promoter of the PIK3CD that encodes p110delta.

The CHK2, a tumor suppressor, is considered to be an important molecular target in ovarian cancer due to its role in DNA repair. Dysfunctional CHK2 impairs DNA damage-induced checkpoints, reduces apoptosis, and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation therapy in ovarian cancer cells. This provides a basis for finding new effective agents targeting CHK2 upregulation or activation to treat or prevent the progression of advanced ovarian cancer. Here, the results show that baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone) treatment inhibits the growth of highly invasive ovarian cancer cells, and that baicalein-induced growth inhibition is mediated by the cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Baicalein-induced G2/M phase arrest is associated with an increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, DNA damage, and CHK2 upregulation and activation. Thus, baicalein modulates the expression of DNA damage response proteins and G2/M phase regulatory molecules. Blockade of CHK2 activation by CHK2 inhibitors protects cells from baicalein-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest. All the results suggest that baicalein has another novel growth inhibitory effect on highly invasive ovarian cancer cells, which is partly related to G2/M cell cycle arrest through the ROS-mediated DNA breakage damage and CHK2 activation. Collectively, our findings provide a molecular basis for the potential of baicalein as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer.", "pmid": "36770705"}

RECENT FINDINGS: APOE4 activates Ca2+ dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) leading to changes in arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid signaling cascades in the brain. Among these changes, the increased conversion of AA to eicosanoids associates with sustained and unresolved chronic brain inflammation. The effects of APOE4 on the brain differ by age, disease stage, nutritional status and can be uncovered by brain imaging studies of brain fatty acid uptake. Reducing cPLA2 expression in the dementia brain presents a viable strategy that awaits to be tested. SUMMARY: Fatty acid brain imaging techniques can clarify how changes to brain polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism during the various phases of AD and guide the development of small molecules to mitigate brain inflammation.", "pmid": "34907965"}

Here we use the localization landscape theory to reveal that the static disorder due to iodide:bromide compositional alloying contributes at most 3 meV to the Urbach energy. Our modeling reveals that the reason for this small contribution is due to the small effective masses in perovskites, resulting in a natural length scale of around 20 nm for the \"effective confining potential\" for electrons and holes, with short-range potential fluctuations smoothed out. The increase in Urbach energy across the compositional range agrees well with our optical absorption measurements. We model systems of sizes up to 80 nm in three dimensions, allowing us to accurately reproduce the experimentally observed absorption spectra of perovskites with halide segregation. Our results suggest that we should look beyond static contribution and focus on the dynamic temperature dependent contribution to the Urbach energy.", "pmid": "36660372"}

Abnormalities in these processes can lead to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic diseases. However, the mechanisms by which these signal molecules fulfill their role remain unclear. Consequently, in this review, we explored the mechanisms of these hormones and signals on obesity and diabetes to suggest potential therapeutic targets for obesity-related metabolic diseases.

We found that although IRF8 was detectable in most reactive B-cells, its expression levels differed with developmental stage. Germinal center B cells contained the highest levels of IRF8, with lower levels seen in mantle and marginal zone B cells and none in plasma cells. IRF8 was coexpressed with PAX-5, Pu.1, and B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-6, and similar to BCL-6, was absent from the small population of IRF4-positive germinal center B cells thought to be committed to postgerminal center developmental programs. Similarly, IRF8 was most strongly expressed in lymphomas of germinal center origin with lower levels present in mantle cell lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and marginal zone lymphomas, and no expression observed in plasmacytic/plasmablastic neoplasms. The reciprocal expression pattern with IRF4 in reactive tissues was generally maintained in lymphomas with some exceptions. These results suggest an important role for IRF8 during germinal center B-cell development and in related lymphomas, and provide a new diagnostic marker helpful in distinguishing B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes.", "pmid": "18580679"}

We employed a unique approach to fabricate two ultrathin (approx. 53 mum) multilayered assemblies to address this. By sequentially stacking thin films of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and polycarbonate (PC) nanocomposites and interfacially locking them with a mutually miscible polymer (PMMA, polymethyl methacrylate), materials with enhanced structural properties and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance can be designed. Utilizing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as a template, ferrite was grown on the surface to design two different nanohybrid structures (rGO-Fe3O4 and MoS2-Fe3O4). PVDF was composited with either rGO-Fe3O4 or MoS2-Fe3O4, and multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were dispersed in the PC component. As PC and PVDF are immiscible, their poor interface would result in inferior structural properties, which can be challenging in designing EMI shielding materials due to cyclic thermal fatigue. Hence, PMMA is sandwiched to interfacially stitch the components (PC and PVDF) and improve interfacial adhesion. This was confirmed using SEM/EDS and Raman mapping/imaging. The mechanical stability of the multilayered assemblies was characterized using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), and the storage modulus was found to be as high as 2767 MPa at 40  C (@constant frequency and strain amplitude), for the multilayered film with rGO-Fe3O4 in PVDF, PMMA as a sandwich layer and CNTs in PC. A typical assembly of 9 multilayers (~480 mum) with rGO-Fe3O4 in PVDF, and CNTs in PC, and interfacially stitched with PMMA gave rise to a high EMI shield effectiveness (SET) of -26.3 dB @ 26.5 GHz.

Missense mutations in the core DNA-binding domain (109-292) simultaneously cause the loss of p53 tumor suppressor function and accumulation of the mutant p53 proteins that are carcinogenic. The most common p53 hotspot mutation at codon 248 in the DNA-binding region, where arginine (R) is substituted by tryptophan (W), glycine (G), leucine (L), proline (P), and glutamine (Q), is reported in various cancers. However, it is unclear how the p53 Arg248 mutation with distinct amino acid substitution affects the structure, function, and DNA binding affinity. Here, we characterized the pathogenicity and protein stability of p53 hotspot mutations at codon 248 using computational tools PredictSNP, Align GVGD, HOPE, ConSurf, and iStable. We found R248W, R248G, and R248P mutations highly deleterious and destabilizing. Further, we subjected all five R248 mutant-p53-DNA and wt-p53-DNA complexes to molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the structural stability and DNA binding affinity. From the MD simulation analysis, we observed increased RMSD, RMSF, and Rg values and decreased protein-DNA intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the R248-p53-DNA than the wt-p53-DNA complexes. Likewise, due to high SASA values, we observed the shrinkage of proteins in R248W, R248G, and R248P mutant-p53-DNA complexes. Compared to other mutant p53-DNA complexes, the R248W, R248G, and R248P mutant-p53-DNA complexes showed more structural alteration. MM-PBSA analysis showed decreased binding energies with DNA in all five R248-p53-DNA mutants than the wt-p53-DNA complexes. Henceforth, we conclude that the amino acid substitution of Arginine with the other five amino acids at codon 248 reduces the p53 protein's affinity for DNA and may disrupt cell division, resulting in a gain of p53 function.

Although targeting radio-resistant cancer cells is important for improving the treatmental efficiency, the signaling pathway- and therapeutic strategy-related to laryngeal carcinoma still require further study. Galangin is an active pharmacological ingredient, isolated from propolis and Alpinia officinarum Hance, and has been reported to have anticancer and anti-oxidative properties through regulation of cell cycle, resulting in angiogenesis, apoptosis, invasion and migration without triggering any toxicity in normal cells. PI3K/AKT and p38 are important signaling pathways to modulate cancer cell apoptosis and proliferation through caspase-3, NF-kappaB and mTOR signal pathways. Autophagy is also enhanced by activating LC3s and Beclin 1. In the present study, galangin was found to suppress laryngeal cancer cell proliferation. Also, flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and western blot analysis indicated that cell apoptosis was induced for galangin administration, promoting caspase-3 expression through regulating PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB. Furthermore, galangin inhibited laryngeal cancer cell proliferation, related to p38 inactivation by galangin treatment. Additionally, mTOR activation regulated by PI3K/AKT was reduced by galangin, suppressing cancer cell transcription and proliferation. Our data also indicated that the tumor volume and weight in nude mice were reduced for galangin use in vivo accompanied by Ki-67 decrease and TUNEL increase in tumor tissues. Together, our data indicated that galangin has a potential role in suppressing human laryngeal cancer via inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, activating apoptosis and autophagy, which were regulated by p38 and AKT/NF-kappaB/mTOR pathways, providing a therapeutic strategy for human laryngeal cancer treatment.", "pmid": "28677816"}

This classification is primarily based on evidence on higher-chlorinated PCBs found in food. The carcinogenic potential of airborne lower-chlorinated PCBs remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate cancer risk following residential exposure to airborne PCBs. METHODS: Cancer risk was examined in the Health Effects of PCBs in Indoor Air (HESPAIR) cohort of 38,613 residents of two partly PCB-contaminated residential areas in Greater Copenhagen, identified by nationwide registries. PCB exposure was based on relocation dates and indoor air PCB measurements in subsets of apartments. Cancer diagnoses were extracted from the Danish Cancer Registry for the follow-up period of 1970-2018. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios with time-varying cumulative exposure and a 10-y lag using Cox regression. RESULTS: Overall risk of cancer was not associated with PCByear, [hazard ratio (HR) for high-exposed vs. low-exposed =0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88, 1.09], but residents exposed to >=3,000 ng/m3 PCBxyear had higher risk of liver cancer (HR =2.81; 95% CI: 1.28, 6.15) and meningiomas (HR =3.49; 95% CI: 1.84, 6.64), with indications of exposure-response relationships. Results were suggestive of a higher risk of pancreatic cancer (HR =1.59; 95% CI: 0.95, 2.64) at the highest aggregated PCB level.

We completed a prospective trial-based economic analysis of Canadian patients to study the direct medical costs and quality-adjusted benefit associated with these therapies. METHODS: Mean survival was calculated using the restricted mean survival method from randomization to the study time-horizon of 24 months. Health state utilities were collected using the EuroQOL EQ-5D instrument with Canadian tariffs applied to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs were applied to resource utilization data (expressed in 2019 US dollars). We examined costs and QALYs associated ibrutinib, ibrutinib with rituximab (IR), and BR therapy. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were enrolled; two patients were excluded from the analysis. On-protocol costs (associated with protocol-specified resource use) were higher for patients receiving ibrutinib (mean $189,335; P < 0.0001) and IR (mean $219,908; P < 0.0001) compared to BR (mean $51,345), driven by higher acquisition costs for ibrutinib. Total mean costs (over 2-years) were $192,615 with ibrutinib, $223,761 with IR, and $55,413 with BR (P < 0.0001 for ibrutinib vs. BR and P < 0.0001 for IR vs. BR). QALYs were similar between the three treatment arms: 1.66 (0.16) for ibrutinib alone, 1.65 (0.24) for IR, and 1.66 (0.17) for BR; therefore, a formal cost-utility analysis was not conducted.

Such unpaved roads become vulnerable during heavy rainy seasons following restrained accessibility among cities and traffic accidents. Considering the circumstances, innovative and cost-effective approaches are required for unpaved roads. Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) is an emerging soil improvement technology using microbes to hydrolyze urea generating carbonate ions, and precipitates calcium carbonate in the presence of calcium ion. Induced calcium carbonate bonds soil particles enhancing stiffness and strength when the MICP reaction takes place within the soil system. This study introduces the use of microbes on unpaved road systems consisting of in situ lateritic soils. The MICP technology was implemented to improve soil strength through two approaches: surface spraying and mixing methods. A series of soil testing was performed with varying chemical concentrations to measure precipitation efficiency, strength, and quality for construction material and see the feasibility of the proposed methods. The laboratory test results indicated that the surface spraying method provided improved; however, it was highly affected by the infiltration characteristics of used soils. The mixing method showed promising results even under submerged conditions, but still required improvement.

The Serum liver function parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were assayed with the commercial kit. The inflammation and scaffold structure in liver were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and silver staining respectively. The LSECs and sub-endothelial basement membrane were observed with the scanning and transmission electronic microscope. The protein expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in liver were analyzed with Western blotting.

However, resistance to AZD9291 arises eventually and EGFRC797S mutation was reported to be a major resistance mechanism. Thus, it is highly valuable to develop novel EGFR fourth-generation inhibitors targeting C797S mutation to override the acquired resistance. In this study, we identified HCD3514 as a novel EGFR fourth-generation inhibitors targeting C797S triple mutation. It strongly inhibited EGFRL858R/T790M/C797S and EGFR19del/T790M/C797S mutations with IC50 values of 1.0 and 2.0 nM, respectively. HCD3514 dose-dependently inhibited the activation of EGFR in both engineered BaF3 cells and tumor cells harboring EGFRC797S triple mutant and thus effectively suppressed the proliferation of the cells. Moreover, HCD3514 caused a dose-dependent increase of apoptosis in C797S triple mutant cells accompanied by increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. Furthermore, HCD3514 induced tumor growth inhibition in EGFR19del/T790M/C797S xenograft model as a single oral agent by decreasing the activation of EGFR. In addition to EGFRC797S triple mutations, HCD3514 also potently and selectively inhibited EGFRT790M double mutations (L858R/T790M and 19del/T790M). Collectively, HCD3514 is a highly selective and potent EGFR inhibitor against EGFRC797S triple mutations as well as EGFRT790M double mutations and is confirmed potently anti-tumor activity in preclinical models.", "pmid": "36605493"}

Currently, BMP2 is used as a bone-regenerative therapy in adults, but in pediatric cases of bone loss, it is not FDA-approved due to concerns of life-threatening inflammation and cancer. Development of a bone-regenerative therapy for children will transform our ability to reduce the morbidity associated with current autologous bone grafting techniques. We discovered that JAGGED1 (JAG1) induces cranial neural crest (CNC) cell osteoblast commitment during craniofacial intramembranous ossification, suggesting that exogenous JAG1 delivery is a potential craniofacial bone-regenerative approach. In this study, we found that JAG1 delivery using synthetic hydrogels containing O9-1 cells, a CNC cell line, into critical-sized calvarial defects in C57BL/6 mice provided robust bone-regeneration. Since JAG1 signals through canonical (Hes1/Hey1) and non-canonical (JAK2) NOTCH pathways in CNC cells, we used RNAseq to analyze transcriptional pathways activated in CNC cells treated with JAG1 +- DAPT, a NOTCH-canonical pathway inhibitor. JAG1 upregulated expression of multiple NOTCH canonical pathway genes (Hes1), which were downregulated in the presence of DAPT. JAG1 also induced bone chemokines (Cxcl1), regulators of cytoskeletal organization and cell migration (Rhou), signaling targets (STAT5), promoters of early osteoblast cell proliferation (Prl2c2, Smurf1 and Esrra), and, inhibitors of osteoclasts (Id1). In the presence of DAPT, expression levels of Hes1 and Cxcl1 were decreased, whereas, Prl2c2, Smurf1, Esrra, Rhou and Id1 remain elevated, suggesting that JAG1 induces osteoblast proliferation through these non-canonical genes. Pathway analysis of JAG1 + DAPT-treated CNC cells revealed significant upregulation of multiple non-canonical pathways, including the cell cycle, tubulin pathway, regulators of Runx2 initiation and phosphorylation of STAT5 pathway. In total, our data show that JAG1 upregulates multiple pathways involved in osteogenesis, independent of the NOTCH canonical pathway. Moreover, our findings suggest that JAG1 delivery using a synthetic hydrogel, is a bone-regenerative approach with powerful translational potential.", "pmid": "32980561"}

This study describes the characteristics of patients with COPD before initiating treatment with a single-device inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2-agonist (ICS/LABA) in primary care in England. METHODS: This is a retrospective, descriptive study of linked primary and secondary healthcare data (Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, Hospital Episode Statistics). Patients with COPD were indexed on first prescription of fixed-dose, single-device ICS/LABA (June 2015-December 2018). Demographics, clinical characteristics, prescribed treatments, healthcare resource use (HCRU) and direct healthcare costs were assessed over 12 months pre-index. Incident users (indexed on first ever prescription) could be non-triple users (no concomitant long-acting muscarinic antagonist at index); a subset were initial maintenance therapy (IMT) users (no history of pre-index maintenance therapy). RESULTS: Overall, 13 451 incident users (non-triple users: 7448, 55.4%; IMT users: 5162, 38.4%) were indexed on beclomethasone dipropionate/formoterol (6122, 45.5%), budesonide/formoterol (2703, 20.1%) or Other ICS/LABA combinations (4626, 34.4%). Overall, 20.8% of incident users had comorbid asthma and 42.6% had >=1 moderate-to-severe acute exacerbation of COPD pre-index. Baseline characteristics were similar across indexed therapies. At 3 months pre-index, 45.3% and 35.4% of non-triple and IMT users were receiving maintenance treatment. HCRU and direct healthcare costs were similar across indexed treatments. Prescribing patterns varied regionally. CONCLUSION: Patient characteristics, prior treatments, prior COPD-related HCRU and direct healthcare costs were similar across single-device ICS/LABAs in primary care in England. A high proportion of patients were not receiving any respiratory medication pre-index, indicating that prescribing in primary care in England is more closely aligned with national guidelines than global treatment strategies. Comorbid asthma may have influenced prescribing decisions. Less than half of users had preindex exacerbations, suggesting that ICS/LABA is not being prescribed principally based on exacerbation history.", "pmid": "36171051"}

METHODS: First, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 480 participants without known diabetes. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered after overnight fasting, and blood samples were collected at 0, 30, and 120 min. Second, a total of 3003 participants were enrolled for the case-control genetic analysis. After assigning them to a case or a control group based on age and CKD status, we investigated the association between BDNF gene variants and susceptibility to CKD. RESULTS: A higher fasting serum BDNF quartile was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of CKD (P value for trend  < 0.001). Based on the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the fasting BDNF level had a larger area under the curve for differentiating CKD (0.645, 95% CI 0.583-0.707) than the BDNF levels at both 30 min (0.547, 95% CI 0.481-0.612) and 120 min (0.598, 95% CI 0.536-0.661). A significantly lower CKD prevalence (odds ratio = 0.30, 95% CI 0.12-0.71) was observed in the highest quartile of fasting BDNF level than that in the lowest quartile, whereas no interquartile differences were observed for BDNF levels determined at 30 or 120 min during the OGTT. Furthermore, BDNF-associated variants, including rs12098908, rs12577517, and rs72891405, were significantly associated with CKD. CONCLUSIONS: The BDNF level at fasting, but not at 30 and 120 min after glucose intake, was an independent indicator of CKD. In addition, significant associations were observed between three BDNF gene variants and CKD.", "pmid": "36782254"}

When activated by cancer cells, adipocytes secrete adipocytokines and release fatty acids, which are then transferred to cancer cells and used for structural and biochemical support. How this metabolic symbiosis between cancer cells and adipocytes affects skeletal muscle and thermogenesis during cancer cachexia is unknown. Cancer cachexia is a multiorgan syndrome and how the communication between tissues is established has yet to be determined. We investigated adipose tissue secretory factors and explored their role in crosstalk of adipocytes, muscle, and tumor during pancreatic cancer cachexia. METHODS: We used a pancreatic cancer cachexia mouse model generated by syngenic implantation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells (KPC) intraperitoneally into C57BL/6 mice and Lcn2-knockout mice. For in vitro studies, adipocytes (3T3-L1 and primary adipocytes), cachectic cancer cells (Panc0203), non-cachectic cancer cells (Du145 cells), and skeletal muscle cells (C2C12 myoblasts) were used. RESULTS: To identify molecules involved in the crosstalk of adipose tissue with muscle and tumors, we treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with conditioned medium (CM) from cancer cells. Upon screening the secretomes from PDAC-induced adipocytes, several adipocytokines were identified, including lipocalin 2 (Lcn2). We investigated Lcn2 as a potential mediator of cachexia induced by adipocytes in response to PDAC. During tumor progression, mice exhibited a decline in body weight gain, which was accompanied by loss of adipose and muscle tissues. Tumor-harboring mice developed drastic hypothermia because of a dramatic loss of fat in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and suppression of the thermogenesis pathway. We inhibited Lcn2 with an anti-Lcn2 antibody neutralization or genomic ablation in mice. Lcn2 deficiency significantly improved body temperature in tumor-bearing mice, which was supported by the increased expression of Ucp1 and beta3-adrenergic receptor in BAT. In addition, Lcn2 inhibition abrogated the loss of fat and muscle in tumor-bearing mice. In contrast to tumor-bearing WT mice, the corresponding Lcn2-knockout mice showed reduced ATGL expression in iWAT and decreased the expression of muscle atrophy molecular markers MuRF-1 and Fbx32. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that Lcn2 is causally involved in the dysregulation of adipose tissue-muscle-tumor crosstalk during pancreatic cancer cachexia. Therapeutic targets that suppress Lcn2 may minimize the progression of cachexia.", "pmid": "36243318"}

Variants 015, 002, 3-3, 3-35, and 3-45 presented G256A, G256E, G257A, G257V, and G257E substitutions, respectively. Cytotoxicity tests were performed for the cell viability of cell lines SW480, SW620, and CaCo-2. Mutants 3-3, 3-35, and 3-45 efficiently killed the cell lines. It was found that the activated forms of caspase-3 and PARP were in higher abundance as well as increased production of gammaH2AX when 3-35 was used to treat CaCo-2 and SW480. To assess possible membrane-binding receptors involved in the interaction, an APN receptor blocking assay showed reduced activity of some parasporins. Hence, we performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the stability of possible interactions and identify the residues that could be involved in the protein-protein interaction of PS2Aa1 and APN. We found that residues 256 and 257 facilitate the interaction. Parasporin 3-35 is promising because it has higher cytotoxicity than PS2Aa1.", "pmid": "36364090"}

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor L3 (ADGRL3) gene are associated with increased susceptibility to developing ADHD worldwide. However, the effect of ADGRL3 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) on the ADGRL3 protein function is vastly unknown. Using several bioinformatics tools to evaluate the impact of mutations, we found that nsSNPs rs35106420, rs61747658, and rs734644, previously reported to be associated and in linkage with ADHD in disparate populations from the world over, are predicted as pathogenic variants. Docking analysis of rs35106420, harbored in the ADGLR3-hormone receptor domain (HRM, a common extracellular domain of the secretin-like GPCRs family), showed that HRM interacts with the Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), part of the incretin hormones family. GIP has been linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, and our analyses suggest a potential link to ADHD. Overall, the comprehensive application of bioinformatics tools showed that functional mutations in the ADGLR3 gene disrupt the standard and wild ADGRL3 structure, most likely affecting its metabolic regulation.

CoSe2, however, has yet to prove its functionality, so we doped palladium oxide (PdO) onto CoSe2 nanostructures using ultraviolet (UV) light, resulting in an efficient and stable water oxidation composite. The crystal arrays, morphology, and chemical composition of the surface were studied using a variety of characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. It was also demonstrated that the composite systems were heterogeneous in their morphology, undergoing a shift in their diffraction patterns, suffering from a variety of metal oxidation states and surface defects. The water oxidation was verified by a low overpotential of 260 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm-2 with a Tafel Slope value of 57 mV dec-1. The presence of multi metal oxidation states, rich surface edges of Se and favorable charge transport played a leading role towards water oxidation with a low energy demand. Furthermore, 48 h of durability is associated with the composite system. With the use of PdO and CoSe2, new, low efficiency, simple electrocatalysts for water catalysis have been developed, enabling the development of practical energy conversion and storage systems.

Among the proteins involved in the calcium signaling pathway, Stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) is a critical endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein. STIM1 is activated by the depletion of calcium stores and then binds to another calcium protein, Orai1, to form a channel through which the extracellular Ca2+ can enter the cytoplasm to replenish the calcium store. Multiple studies have shown that increased STIM1 facilitates the aberrant proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth cells (VSMC) and macrophages which can promote the formation of rupture-prone plaque. Together with regulating the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, STIM1 also activates STING through altered intracellular Ca2+ concentration, a critical pro-inflammatory molecule. The cGAS-STING pathway is linked with cellular proliferation and phenotypic conversion of VSMC and enhances the progression of atherosclerosis plaque. In summary, we conclude that STIM1/cGAS-STING is involved in the progression of AS and plaque vulnerability.", "pmid": "36465175"}

METHODS: Seventy Swiss albino female mice (25-35 g) were divided into 4 groups: amphetamine-free (control), amphetamine, 50, and 100 mg/kg DHEA. The DHEA was administered intraperitoneally (ip) for 5 days. Amphetamine (3 mg/kg ip) induced hyper locomotion, apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously [sc]) induced climbing, and haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg sc) induced catalepsy tests were used as animal models of schizophrenia. The study was conducted at the Animal Experiment Laboratories, Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey between March and May 2012. Statistical analysis was carried out using Kruskal-Wallis test for hyper locomotion, and one-way ANOVA for climbing and catalepsy tests. RESULTS: In the amphetamine-induced locomotion test, there were significant increases in all movements compared with the amphetamine-free group. Both DHEA 50 mg/kg (p<0.05), and 100 mg/kg (p<0.01) significantly decreased all movements compared with the amphetamine-induced locomotion group. There was a significant difference between groups in the haloperidol-induced catalepsy test (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between groups in terms of total climbing time in the apomorphine-induced climbing test (p>0.05).

Because KRAS itself is a challenging therapeutic target, we focused on understanding key signaling pathways driven by KRAS as a way to reveal dependencies that are amenable to therapeutic intervention. Analyses in primary human pancreatic cancers and model systems revealed that the receptor for the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is downregulated by mutant KRAS. Furthermore, downregulation of the LIF receptor (LIFR) is necessary for KRAS-mediated neoplastic transformation. We found LIFR exerts inhibitory effects on KRAS-mediated transformation by inhibiting expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1, a key mediator of the enhanced glycolysis found in KRAS-driven malignancies. Decreased LIFR expression leads to increased GLUT1 as well as increases in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. The repression of GLUT1 by LIFR is mediated by the transcription factor STAT3, indicating a tumor-suppressive role for STAT3 within cancer cells with mutated KRAS. Finally, reflecting a clinically important tumor-suppressive role of LIFR, decreased LIFR expression correlates with shorter survival in pancreatic cancer patients with mutated KRAS. Similar findings were found in non-small cell lung cancers driven by mutated KRAS, suggesting that silencing LIFR is a generalized mechanism of KRAS-mediated cellular transformation. These results indicate that the LIFR/STAT3 pathway may mediate either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive signaling pathways depending on the genetic background of tumor cells, and may play diverse roles within other cells in the tumor microenvironment. IMPLICATIONS: Mutant KRAS drives downregulation of the receptor for LIF, thereby allowing an increase in expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and increases in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration.", "pmid": "33931487"}

To explain the molecular mechanism of this disease with hematological abnormalities in an affected family, we conducted a genetic analysis of SLC4A1 and studied wild-type and mutant AE1 proteins expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. METHODS: SLC4A1 mutations in the patient and family members were analyzed by molecular genetic techniques. Protein structure modeling was initially conducted to evaluate the effects of mutations on the three-dimensional structure of the AE1 protein. The mutant kidney anion exchanger 1 (kAE1) plasmid construct was created to study protein expression, localization, and stability in HEK293T cells. RESULTS: We discovered that the patient who had AR dRTA coexisting with mild hemolytic anemia carried a novel compound heterozygous SLC4A1 mutations containing c.1199_1225del (p.Ala400_Ala408del), resulting in Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO), and c.1331C > A (p.Thr444Asn).

T-cell activation is negatively regulated by C-terminal Src kinase (CSK); however, the exact mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that the conserved oncogenic tyrosine kinase Activated CDC42 kinase 1 (ACK1) is able to phosphorylate CSK at Tyrosine 18 (pY18), which enhances CSK function, constraining T-cell activation. Mice deficient in the Tnk2 gene encoding Ack1, are characterized by diminished CSK Y18-phosphorylation and spontaneous activation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, resulting in inhibited growth of transplanted ICB-resistant tumours. Furthermore, ICB treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients results in re-activation of ACK1/pY18-CSK signalling, confirming the involvement of this pathway in ICB insensitivity. An ACK1 small-molecule inhibitor, (R)-9b, recapitulates inhibition of ICB-resistant tumours, which provides evidence for ACK1 enzymatic activity playing a pivotal role in generating ICB resistance.

Due to physical and chemical methodological difficulties for SDS removal, phytoremediation techniques are efficient alternative strategies to tackle such adversities. Juncus acutus L.

To our knowledge, the role of exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in improving the phytoextraction of SDS has not been examined yet. In this study, pretreatment foliar spray of H2O2 (15 mM) combined with two levels of SDS (50 and 100 ppm) in water culture was evaluated to remove SDS contamination and add value to the phytoremediation process. RESULTS: The outcomes revealed that J. acutus has considerable translocation and bioaccumulation abilities for SDS and can be utilized as an appropriate hyperaccumulator in SDS-contaminated sites. However, the involvement of H2O2 extended phytoremediation capacity and successive removal of SDS. H2O2 significantly assisted in increasing SDS remediation via more accumulation in J. acutus tissues by 29.9 and 112.4% and decreasing SDS concentration in culture media by 33.3 and 27.3% at 50 and 100 ppm SDS, respectively. Bioaccumulation factor (BCF) increased by 13.8 and 13.2%, while translocation factor (TCF) positively maximized by 82.4 and 76.2% by H2O2 application at 50 and 100 ppm SDS, respectively.

Here, we examined the clinical and therapeutic relevance of IAPs in colorectal cancer. We found that elevated expression of cIAP1 and cIAP2 (but not XIAP) significantly correlated with poor prognosis in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) stage III colorectal cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting their involvement in promoting chemoresistance. A novel IAP antagonist tolinapant (ASTX660) potently and rapidly downregulated cIAP1 in colorectal cancer models, demonstrating its robust on-target efficacy. In cells co-cultured with TNFalpha to mimic an inflammatory tumor microenvironment, tolinapant induced caspase-8-dependent apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell line models; however, the extent of apoptosis was limited because of inhibition by the caspase-8 paralogs FLIP and, unexpectedly, caspase-10. Importantly, tolinapant-induced apoptosis was augmented by FOLFOX in human colorectal cancer and murine organoid models in vitro and in vivo, due (at least in part) to FOLFOX-induced downregulation of class I histone deacetylases (HDAC), leading to acetylation of the FLIP-binding partner Ku70 and downregulation of FLIP. Moreover, the effects of FOLFOX could be phenocopied using the clinically relevant class I HDAC inhibitor, entinostat, which also induced acetylation of Ku70 and FLIP downregulation. Further analyses revealed that caspase-8 knockout RIPK3-positive colorectal cancer models were sensitive to tolinapant-induced necroptosis, an effect that could be exploited in caspase-8-proficient models using the clinically relevant caspase inhibitor emricasan.

Recently, it has been reported that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor to glutathione (GSH), attenuates clasmatodendritic degeneration and shortens spontaneous seizure duration in chronic epilepsy rats, although the underlying mechanisms of its anti-convulsive effects are not fully understood. To elucidate this, the present study was designed to investigate whether NAC affects astroglial glutamine synthase (GS) expression mediated by GSH peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and/or peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) in the epileptic hippocampus. As compared to control animals, GS and GPx1 expressions were upregulated in reactive CA1 astrocytes of chronic epilepsy rats, while their expressions were significantly decreased in clasmatodendritic CA1 astrocytes and reactive astrocytes within the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Prdx6 expression was increased in reactive CA1 astrocytes as well as clasmatodendritic CA1 astrocytes. In the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, Prdx6 expression levels were similar to those in control animals. NAC ameliorated clasmatodendrosis through the increment of GS and GPx1 expressions, while it abolished Prdx6 upregulation. 1-hexadecyl-3-(trifluoroethgl)-sn-glycerol-2 phosphomethanol (MJ33, a selective inhibitor of aiPLA2 activity of Prdx6) alleviated clasmatodendrosis by enhancing GPx1 and GS expressions in clasmatodendritic CA1 astrocytes without changing the Prdx6 level. NAC or MJ33 did not affect GS, GPx1 and Prdx6 expression in astrocytes within the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. These findings indicate that upregulated aiPLA2 activity of Prdx6 may abolish GPx1-mediated GS preservation and lead to clasmatodendrosis in CA1 astrocytes, which would extend spontaneous seizure duration due to impaired glutamate-glutamine conversion regulated by GS. Therefore, the present data suggest that aiPLA2 activity of Prdx6 in astrocytes may be one of the upstream effectors of seizure duration in the epileptic hippocampus.", "pmid": "36671018"}

It has been demonstrated that CGRP increases orofacial pain induced by NGF. V-type proton ATPase subunit an isoform 1 (Atp6v0a1) is involved in the exocytosis pathway, especially in vesicular transport in neurons. The objective was to examine the role of Atp6v0a1 in NGF-induced upregulation of CGRP in orofacial pain induced by experimental tooth movement. Orofacial pain was elicited by ligating closed-coil springs between incisors and molars in Sprague-Dawley rats. Gene and protein expression levels were determined through real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunostaining, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Lentivirus vectors carrying Atp6v0a1 shRNA were used to knockdown the expression of Atp6v0a1 in TG and SH-SY5Y neurons. The release of vesicles in SH-SY5Y neurons was observed by using fluorescence dye FM1-43, and the release of CGRP was detected by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assy. Orofacial pain was evaluated through the rat grimace scale. Our results revealed that intraganglionic administration of NGF and Atp6v0a1 shRNA upregulated and downregulated CGRP in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc), respectively, and the orofacial pain was also exacerbated and alleviated, respectively, following administration of NGF and Atp6v0a1 shRNA. Besides, intraganglionic administration of NGF simultaneously caused the downregulation of Atp6v0a1 in TG. Moreover, the release of vesicles and CGRP in SH-SY5Y neurons was interfered by NGF and Atp6v0a1 shRNA. In conclusion, in the orofacial pain induced by experimental tooth movement, NGF induced the upregulation of CGRP in TG and Vc, and this process is dependent on Atp6v0a1 and vesicle release, suggesting that they are involved in the transmission of nociceptive information in orofacial pain.", "pmid": "36232740"}

Gaertn., a healthy, green vegetable with low sugar and high protein contents and high medicinal value, is severely affected by autotoxicity, which is a leading factor in the formation of plant disease. To help characterize the autotoxicity mechanism of P. cornutum (L.) Gaertn., we performed transcriptomic and metabolic analysis of the roots of P. cornutum (L.) Gaertn. response to phthalic acid, an autotoxin from P. cornutum (L.) Gaertn. RESULTS: In this study, high-throughput sequencing of nine RNA-seq libraries generated from the roots.of P. cornutum (L.) Gaertn. under different phthalic acid treatments yielded 37,737 unigenes. In total, 1085 (703 upregulated and 382 downregulated) and 5998 (4385 upregulated and 1613 downregulated) DEGs were identified under 0.1 and 10 mmol L- 1 phthalic acid treatment, respectively, compared with the control treatment. Glutathione metabolism was among the top five important enriched pathways. In total, 457 and 435 differentially accumulated metabolites were detected under 0.1 and 10 mmol L- 1 phthalic acid treatment compared with the control, respectively, of which 223 and 253, respectively, increased in abundance. With the increase in phthalic acid concentration, the accumulation of ten metabolites increased significantly, while that of four metabolites decreased significantly, and phthalic acid, dambonitol, 4-hydroxy-butyric acid, homocitrulline, and ethyl beta-D-glucopyranoside were 100 times more abundant under the 10 mmol L- 1 phthalic acid treatment than under the control. Seventeen differentially expressed genes significantly associated with phthalic acid content were identified. In addition, the L-histidinol content was highest under 0.1 mmol L- 1 phthalic acid, and a total of eleven differentially expressed genes were significantly positively correlated with the L-histidinol content, all of which were annotated to heat shock proteins, aquaporins and cysteine proteases. CONCLUSIONS: Accumulation of autotoxins altered the metabolic balance in P. cornutum (L.) Gaertn. and influenced water absorption and carbon and nitrogen metabolism. These important results provide insights into the formation mechanisms of autotoxicity and for the subsequent development of new control measures to improve the production and quality of replanted plants.", "pmid": "36396992"}

In pregnancy, TGF-beta1 is abundant at the maternal-fetal interface. TGF-beta1 has been reported to enhance rubella virus binding and infection in human lung epithelial cells. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the role of TGF-beta1 in ZIKV infection in the immortalized human first-trimester trophoblasts, i.e., Swan.71. The cells were treated with TGF-beta1 (10 ng/mL) for two days before being inoculated with the virus (American strain PRVABC59) at a multiplicity of infection of five. The results showed an enhancement of ZIKV infection, as demonstrated by the immunofluorescent assay and flow cytometry analysis. Such enhanced infection effects were abolished using SB431542 or SB525334, inhibitors of the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway. An approximately 2-fold increase in the virus binding to the studied trophoblasts was found. In the presence of the Smad inhibitors, virus replication was significantly suppressed. An enhancement in Tyro3 and AXL (receptors for ZIKV) expression induced by TGF-beta1 was also noted. The results suggest that TGF-beta1 promotes the virus infection via the Smad pathway. Further studies should be carried out to clarify the underlying mechanisms of these findings.", "pmid": "36230987"}

Previously, we have reported induction of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1), a novel neuronal protein of long-pentraxin family, following HI neuronal injury. Here, we investigated how this specific signal is propagated to cause the HI neuronal death. We used wild-type (WT) and NP1 knockout (NP1-KO) mouse hippocampal cultures, modeled in vitro following exposure to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), and in vivo neonatal (P9-10) mouse model of HI brain injury. Our results show induction of NP1 in primary hippocampal neurons following OGD exposure (4-8 h) and in the ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions at 24-48 h post-HI compared to the contralateral side. We also found increased PTEN activity concurrent with OGD time-dependent (4-8 h) dephosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and GSK-3b (Ser9). OGD also caused a time-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of Bad (Ser136), and Bax protein levels. Immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation analyses revealed increased mitochondrial translocation of Bad and Bax proteins from cytoplasm following OGD (4 h) and simultaneously increased release of Cyt C from mitochondria followed by activation of caspase-3. NP1 protein was immunoprecipitated with Bad and Bax proteins; OGD caused increased interactions of NP1 with Bad and Bax, thereby, facilitating their mitochondrial translocation and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (D (m)). This NP1 induction preceded the increased mitochondrial release of cytochrome C (Cyt C) into the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and OGD time-dependent cell death in WT primary hippocampal neurons. In contrast, in NP1-KO neurons there was no translocation of Bad and Bax from cytosol to the mitochondria, and no evidence of D (m) loss, increased Cyt C release and caspase-3 activation following OGD; which resulted in significantly reduced neuronal death. Our results indicate a regulatory role of NP1 in Bad/Bax-dependent mitochondrial release of Cyt C and caspase-3 activation. Together our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which NP1 regulates mitochondria-driven hippocampal cell death; suggesting NP1 as a potential therapeutic target against HI brain injury in neonates.", "pmid": "23069675"}

Thymol is a monoterpene phenol which has been reported to possess an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity versus 5-FU-induced IM. The Notch pathway affects multiple cellular activities, such as cellular proliferation, in addition to inflammatory responses modulation. Accordingly, this work was carried out in order to elucidate the role of the Notch pathway in 5-FU-induced IM and to further elucidate the immunomodulatory protective mechanisms of thymol. Experimental rats were divided randomly into four groups: Control, 5-FU, 5-FU+thymol (60 mg/kg/day), and 5-FU+thymol (120 mg/kg/day). 5-FU was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 150 mg/kg on days 6 and 7, while thymol was orally administered daily for 11 days. By the end of the study, intestinal tissues were collected for the determination of IL-17, CD4, CD8, Notch1, Hes-1, pSTAT3, and STAT-3 protein expressions. The effect of thymol on 5-FU cytotoxicity was also examined using WST1 assay. 5-FU induced a marked increase in IL-17 levels, along with a marked downregulation of CD4 and the upregulation of CD8, Notch1, Hes-1 protein expressions, and activation of STAT3 in the intestinal tissue when compared with the control group. Thymol ameliorated the changes that occurred in these parameters. Additionally, cytotoxicity testing revealed that thymol augmented the antiproliferative action of 5-FU against breast and colorectal human cancer cell lines.

DESIGN: Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial Ruxolitinib in Participants With COVID-19-Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Who Require Mechanical Ventilation (RUXCOVID-DEVENT; NCT04377620). SETTING: Hospitals and community-based private or group practices in the United States (29 sites) and Russia (4 sites). PATIENTS: Eligible patients were greater than or equal to 12 years old, hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and mechanically ventilated with a Pao2/Fio2 of less than or equal to 300 mm Hg within 6 hours of randomization. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive twice-daily ruxolitinib 15 mg, ruxolitinib 5 mg, or placebo, each plus standard therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary endpoint, 28-day mortality, was tested for each ruxolitinib group versus placebo using a mixed-effects logistic regression model and one-tailed significance test (significance threshold: p < 0.025); no type 1 error was allocated to secondary endpoints. Between May 24, 2020 and December 15, 2020, 211 patients (age range, 24-87 yr) were randomized (ruxolitinib 15/5 mg, n = 77/87; placebo, n = 47). Acute respiratory distress syndrome was categorized as severe in 27% of patients (58/211) at randomization; 90% (190/211) received concomitant steroids. Day-28 mortality was 51% (39/77; 95% CI, 39-62%) for ruxolitinib 15 mg, 53% (45/85; 95% CI, 42-64%) for ruxolitinib 5 mg, and 70% (33/47; 95% CI, 55-83%) for placebo. Neither ruxolitinib 15 mg (odds ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.201-1.028]; one-sided p = 0.029) nor 5 mg (odds ratio, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.171-1.023]; one-sided p = 0.028) significantly reduced 28-day mortality versus placebo. Numerical improvements with ruxolitinib 15 mg versus placebo were observed in secondary outcomes including ventilator-, ICU-, and vasopressor-free days. Rates of overall and serious treatment-emergent adverse events were similar across treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The observed reduction in 28-day mortality rate between ruxolitinib and placebo in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome was not statistically significant; however, the trial was underpowered owing to early termination.", "pmid": "36226977"}
{"abstract_id": "1474", "title": "AtGSTU19 and AtGSTU24 as Moderators of the Response of Arabidopsis thaliana to Turnip mosaic virus.", "abstract": "Plants produce glutathione as a response to the intercellular redox state. Glutathione actively participates in the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent signaling pathway, especially under biotic stress conditions. Most of the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are induced in cells during the defense response of plants not only through highly specific glutathione-binding abilities but also by participating in the signaling function. The tau class of GSTs has been reported to be induced as a response under stress conditions. Although several studies have focused on the role of the tau class of GSTs in plant-pathogen interactions, knowledge about their contribution to the response to virus inoculation is still inadequate. Therefore, in this study, the response of Atgstu19 and Atgstu24 knockout mutants to mechanical inoculation of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) was examined. The systemic infection of TuMV was more dynamically promoted in Atgstu19 mutants than in wild-type (Col-0) plants, suggesting the role of GSTU19 in TuMV resistance. However, Atgstu24 mutants displayed virus limitation and downregulation of the relative expression of TuMV capsid protein, accompanied rarely by TuMV particles only in vacuoles, and ultrastructural analyses of inoculated leaves revealed the lack of virus cytoplasmic inclusions. These findings indicated that Atgstu24 mutants displayed a resistance-like reaction to TuMV, suggesting that GSTU24 may suppress the plant resistance. In addition, these findings confirmed that GSTU1 and GSTU24 are induced and contribute to the susceptible reaction to TuMV in the Atgstu19-TuMV interaction. However, the upregulation of GSTU19 and GSTU13 highly correlated with virus limitation in the resistance-like reaction in the Atgstu24-TuMV interaction. Furthermore, the highly dynamic upregulation of GST and glutathione reductase (GR) activities resulted in significant induction (between 1 and 14 days post inoculation [dpi]) of the total glutathione pool (GSH + GSSG) in response to TuMV, which was accompanied by the distribution of active glutathione in plant cells. On the contrary, in Atgstu19, which is susceptible to TuMV interaction, upregulation of GST and GR activity only up to 7 dpi symptom development was reported, which resulted in the induction of the total glutathione pool between 1 and 3 dpi. These observations indicated that GSTU19 and GSTU24 are important factors in modulating the response to TuMV in Arabidopsis thaliana. Moreover, it was clear that glutathione is an important component of the regulatory network in resistance and susceptible response of A. thaliana to TuMV. These results help achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating the Arabidopsis-TuMV pathosystem.", "pmid": "36232831"}

It is a result of the imbalance between adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow cells. Phytochemicals can alleviate osteoporotic complications by hindering bone loss and decreasing bone marrow adiposity. Corydalis heterocarpa is a biennial halophyte with reported bioactivities, and it is a source of different coumarin derivatives. Libanoridin is a coumarin isolated from C. heterocarpa, and the effect of libanoridin on adipogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) was evaluated in the present study. Cells were induced to undergo adipogenesis, and their intracellular lipid accumulation and expression of adipogenic markers were observed under libanoridin treatment. Results showed that 10 muM libanoridin-treated adipocytes accumulated 44.94% less lipid compared to untreated adipocytes. In addition, mRNA levels of PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, and SREBP1c were dose-dependently suppressed with libanoridin treatment, whereas only protein levels of PPARgamma were decreased in the presence of libanoridin. Fluorescence staining of adipocytes also revealed that cells treated with 10 muM libanoridin expressed less PPARgamma compared to untreated adipocytes. Protein levels of perilipin and leptin, markers of mature adipocytes, were also suppressed in adipocytes treated with 10 muM libanoridin. Analysis of MAPK phosphorylation levels showed that treatment with libanoridin inhibited the activation of p38 and JNK MAPKs observed by decreased levels of phosphorylated p38 and JNK protein. It was suggested that libanoridin inhibited adipogenic differentiation of hBM-MSCs via suppressing MAPK-mediated PPARgamma signaling.

However, it remains unknown whether ODC is required for other arms of the resolution program. Approach and Results: RNA sequencing of ODC-deficient macrophages exposed to ACs showed increases in mRNAs associated with heightened inflammation and decreases in mRNAs related to resolution and repair compared with WT (wild type) macrophages. In zymosan peritonitis, myeloid ODC deletion led to delayed clearance of neutrophils and a decrease in the proresolving cytokine, IL (interleukin)-10. Nanoparticle-mediated silencing of macrophage ODC in a model of atherosclerosis regression lowered IL-10 expression, decreased efferocytosis, enhanced necrotic core area, and reduced fibrous cap thickness. Mechanistically, ODC deletion lowered basal expression of MerTK (MER tyrosine-protein kinase)-an AC receptor-via a histone methylation-dependent transcriptional mechanism. Owing to lower basal MerTK, subsequent exposure to ACs resulted in lower MerTK-Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2-dependent IL-10 production. Putrescine treatment of ODC-deficient macrophages restored the expression of both MerTK and AC-induced IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that ODC-dependent putrescine synthesis in macrophages maintains a basal level of MerTK expression needed to optimally resolve inflammation upon subsequent AC exposure.

We investigated associations between 10 specific antipsychotic medications and subsequent risks for a range of criminal outcomes. METHODS: We identified 74 925 individuals who were ever prescribed antipsychotics between 2006 and 2013 using nationwide Swedish registries. We tested for five specific first-generation antipsychotics (levomepromazine, perphenazine, haloperidol, flupentixol, and zuclopenthixol) and five second-generation antipsychotics (clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole). The outcomes included violent, drug-related, and any criminal arrests and convictions. We conducted within-individual analyses using fixed-effects Poisson regression models that compared rates of outcomes between periods when each individual was either on or off medication to account for time-stable unmeasured confounders. All models were adjusted for age and concurrent mood stabilizer medications. RESULTS: The relative risks of all crime outcomes were substantially reduced [range of adjusted rate ratios (aRRs): 0.50-0.67] during periods when the patients were prescribed antipsychotics v. periods when they were not. We found that clozapine (aRRs: 0.28-0.44), olanzapine (aRRs: 0.46-0.72), and risperidone (aRRs: 0.53-0.64) were associated with lower arrest and conviction risks than other antipsychotics, including quetiapine (aRRs: 0.68-0.84) and haloperidol (aRRs: 0.67-0.77).

Emerging evidence indicates that voltage-dependent Na(+) channels have pivotal roles in the cardiotoxicity of aconitine. However, no reports are available on the role of Ca(2+) in aconitine poisoning. In this study, we explored the importance of pathological Ca(2+) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo. We found that Ca(2+) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious freely moving rats. To investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury, we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats. The results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability dose-dependently. To confirm the pro-apoptotic effects, we performed flow cytometric detection, cardiac histology, transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay. The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time-dependently. The expression analysis of Ca(2+) handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca(2+) overload through the expression regulation of Ca(2+) handling proteins. The expression analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that pro-apoptotic protein expression was upregulated, and anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 expression was downregulated. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members, especially the P-P38/P38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues. Hence, our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates Ca(2+) overload and causes arrhythmia and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.", "pmid": "24840785"}

Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a zinc-metalloprotease with a high affinity for insulin, has been found in the interactomes of multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins. However, the relevance of IDE in the innate and adaptative immune responses elicited by circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells is unknown. Here, we show that IDE is highly expressed on the surface of circulating monocytes, T-cells (both CD4+ and CD4-), and, to a lower extent, in B-cells from healthy controls. Notably, IDE's surface expression was upregulated on monocytes from COVID-19 patients at diagnosis, and it was increased in more severe patients. However, IDE's surface expression was downregulated (relative to healthy controls) 3 months after hospital discharge in all the studied immune subsets, with this effect being more pronounced in males than in females, and thus it was sex-dependent. Additionally, IDE levels in monocytes, CD4+ T-cells, and CD4- T-cells were inversely correlated with circulating insulin levels in COVID-19 patients (both at diagnosis and after hospital discharge). Of note, high glucose and insulin levels downregulated IDE surface expression by ~30% in the monocytes isolated from healthy donors, without affecting its expression in CD4+ T-cells and CD4- T-cells. In conclusion, our studies reveal the sex- and metabolism-dependent regulation of IDE in monocytes, suggesting that its regulation might be important for the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, as well as for glucometabolic control, in COVID-19 patients.", "pmid": "36232381"}

Paradoxically, opioids have also been implicated in inducing neuroinflammation and associated neurocognitive decline. Pericytes, a critical component of the neurovascular unit (NVU), are centrally positioned between endothelial cells and astrocytes, maintaining function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) nd regulating neuroinflammation by controlling monocyte influx under various pathological conditions. The role of pericytes in morphine-mediated neuroinflammation however, has received less attention, especially in the context of how pericytes crosstalk with other central nervous system (CNS) cells. The current study was undertaken to examine the effect of miRNAs released from morphine-stimulated human primary astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (morphine-ADEVs) in mediating pericyte loss at the blood-brain barrier, leading, in turn, to increased influx of peripheral monocytes. Our findings suggest that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex A2/B1 (hnRNP A2/B1) plays role in morphine-mediated upregulation and release of miR-23a in ADEVs, and through action of morphine via mu opioid receptor.We further demonstrated that miR-23a in morphine-ADEVs could be taken up by pericytes, resulting in downregulation of PTEN expression, ultimately leading to increased pericyte migration. Furthermore, both overexpression of PTEN and blocking the miR-23a target site at PTEN 3UTR (by transfecting miR-23a-PTEN target protector), attenuated morphine-ADEV-mediated pericyte migration. We also demonstrated that in the microvessels isolated from morphine-administered mice, there were fewer PDGFbetaR + pericytes co-localizing with CD31+ brain endothelial cells compared with those from saline mice. In line with these findings, we also observed increased loss of pericytes and a concomitantly increased influx of monocytes in the brains of morphine-administered pericyte-labeled NG2-DsRed mice compared with saline mice. In conclusion, our findings indicate morphine-ADEVs mediated loss of pericyte coverage at the brain endothelium, thereby increasing the influx of peripheral monocytes in the central nervous system, leading to neuroinflammation.", "pmid": "36478740"}

Thus far, although two loci for DSAP have been identified, the genetic basis and pathogenesis of this disorder have not been elucidated yet. In this study, we performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in three Chinese affected families and localized the gene in an 8.0 cM interval defined by D12S330 and D12S354 on chromosome 12. Upon screening 30 candidate genes, we identified a missense mutation, p.Ser63Asn in SSH1 in one family, a frameshift mutation, p.Ser19CysfsX24 in an alternative variant (isoform f) of SSH1 in another family, and a frameshift mutation, p.Pro27ProfsX54 in the same alternative variant in one non-familial case with DSAP. SSH1 encodes a phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in actin dynamics. Our data suggested that cytoskeleton disorganization in epidermal cells is likely associated with the pathogenesis of DSAP.", "pmid": "15459975"}

Many of these hereditary factors consist of defined gene polymorphisms, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or insertion-deletion polymorphisms, which directly or indirectly affect the hemostatic system. The frequencies of individual hemostatic gene polymorphisms in different normal populations are well defined. However, descriptions of patterns of genetic variability of a larger extent of different factors of hereditary hypercoagulability in single populations are scarce. The aim of this study was i) to give a detailed description of the frequencies of factors of hereditary thrombophilia and their combinations in a German population (n = 282) and ii) to compare their distributions with those reported for other regions. Variants of coagulation factors [factor V 1691G>A (factor V Leiden), factor V 4070A>G (factor V HR2 haplotype), factor VII Arg353Gln, factor XIII Val34Leu, beta-fibrinogen -455G>A, prothrombin 20210G>A], coagulation inhibitors [tissue factor pathway inhibitor 536C>T, thrombomodulin 127G>A], fibrinolytic factors [angiotensin converting enzyme intron 16 insertion/deletion, factor VII-activating protease 1601G>A (FSAP Marburg I), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1-675 insertion/deletion (5G/4G), tissue plasminogen activator intron h deletion/insertion], and other factors implicated in influencing susceptibility to thromboembolic diseases [apolipoprotein E2/E3/E4, glycoprotein Ia 807C>T, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677C>T] were included.

METHODS: Patients and family members were given complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of venous blood of six individuals in the family and 170 healthy Chinese individuals. All of the 65 coding exons and their flanking intronic boundaries of FBN1 were amplified in the proband by polymerase chain reaction and followed by direct sequencing. The mutation identified in the proband was screened in the other family members and the 170 healthy Chinese individuals by direct sequencing. Protein conservation analysis was performed in six species using an online ClustalW tool. Protein structure was modeled based on the Protein data bank and mutated in DeepView v4.0.1 to predict the functional consequences of the mutation. RESULTS: A novel heterozygous c.3703T>C change in exon 29 of FBN1 was detected in the proband, which resulted in the substitution of serine by proline at codon 1235 (p.S1235P). This mutation was also present in two family members but absent in the other, unaffected family members and the 170 healthy Chinese individuals. The mutant residue located in the calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like#15 domain is highly conserved among mammalian species and could probably induce conformation change of the domain. CONCLUSIONS: We indentified a novel p.S1235P mutation in FBN1, which is the causative mutation for MFS in this family. Our result expands the mutation spectrum of FBN1 and contributes to the study of the molecular pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome.", "pmid": "21976953"}

Increased Oxidative Stress (OS) and decreased antioxidant cell defense are the suggested mechanisms of carcinogenicity and toxicity of As. As a powerful antioxidant and water-soluble compound, vitamin C protects cells and tissues against oxidation and has a wide range of healing properties. Objectives: The current study aimed to formulate a suitable ascorbic acid (vitamin C) niosome and compare it with vitamin C in preventing As-induced toxicity in HEK-293 cells. Methods: Various formulas of vitamin C niosomes were prepared by C-SPAN mixed with cholesterol. The physicochemical characteristics of niosomal formulations, including load size, zeta-potential, and the drug release profile, were evaluated in HEK-293 cells. Then, OS biomarkers such as total reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), Antioxidant Capacity (TAC), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities determined the protective effects of vitamin C niosomes compared with vitamin C against As-induced toxicity. Results: The particle size and zeta potential of the optimal vitamin C niosome were 163.2 +- 6.1 nm and 23.3 +- 3.5 mV, respectively. Arsenic increased ROS and MDA levels while decreasing CAT, TAC, and SOD activities in the HEK-293 cell line. Finally, the vitamin C niosome decreased OS and increased antioxidant properties more than vitamin C.

Since treatment options for CAS are controversial, and because only paclitaxel should be recommended based on high-level evidence, it is important to evaluate the efficacy of another taxane-derived agents, docetaxel, in real-world practice. The efficacy and safety profiles of chemoradiotherapy using taxane-based agents, docetaxel and paclitaxel, were retrospectively examined in the maintenance setting in 90 Japanese CAS patients, including 35 docetaxel-treated cases and 55 paclitaxel-treated cases. Overall survival and dose duration time of the patient group treated with docetaxel was equivalent to that with paclitaxel, even in the cohorts with metastasis. Adverse events due to docetaxel and paclitaxel were observed in 77.1% and 69.1% of cases, respectively. The incidence ratio of total severe adverse events tended to be higher in the docetaxel-treated group (40.0%) than in the paclitaxel-treated group (23.6%). Peripheral neuropathy occurred only in the paclitaxel-treated group, whereas high-grade interstitial pneumonia developed only in the docetaxel-treated group. In addition, we also evaluate 19 patients selected other taxanes, 17 patients selected eribulin methylate, 11 patients pazopanib, and 2 patients selected nivolumab as second-line chemotherapy. The efficacy of a monthly docetaxel regimen is equivalent to a three-weekly paclitaxel regimen evaluated by Overall survival and DDT, even in the cohorts with metastasis, and it is a tolerable protocol for CAS as a maintenance therapy in the Japanese population.", "pmid": "36751323"}

MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with liver cirrhosis (n=148) aged 18-65 years and undergoing gastroscopy were randomly and equally allocated to receive either 0.107 mg/kg remimazolam tosilate (remimazolam group) or 2 mg/kg propofol. Patients received intravenous sufentanil 0.15 mug/kg before the study drug. If necessary, an additional dose of propofol 20 mg was used and repeated. The primary outcome was the satisfaction rating (satisfactory, fair, or unsatisfactory) of the endoscopist with the sedation. Secondary outcomes were complications (respiratory depression, apnea, body movement, bradycardia, hypotension, nausea or vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, and fever) and patient satisfaction. RESULTS Compared with the propofol group, the remimazolam group required a longer time to sedation and a shorter time to emergence. The percentage of remimazolam sedations the endoscopist rated satisfactory (90.5%) was higher than that for propofol (77.0%; P=0.026). Patients given remimazolam experienced lower rates of respiratory depression, body movement, and hypotension (2.7, 8.1, 4.1%, respectively), than did the propofol group (17.6, 23.0, 14.9%; P=0.003, 0.013, 0.025). The 2 groups were comparable regarding the other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS For Chinese patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing gastroscopy, remimazolam tosilate with adjuvant sufentanil provides a satisfactory level of sedation with a good safety profile.", "pmid": "35706340"}

BCR-ABL, a product of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, is a structurally active tyrosine kinase and plays an important role in CML disease pathogenesis. Imatinib mesylate (IMA) is a strong and selective BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Although IMA therapy is an effective treatment, patients may develop resistance to IMA therapy over time. This study investigated the possible genetic resistance mechanisms in patients developing resistance to IMA. We did DNA sequencing in order to detect BCR-ABL mutations, which are responsible for IMA resistance. Moreover, we analyzed the mRNA expression levels of genes responsible for apoptosis, such as BCL-2, P53, and other genes (SCD-1, PTEN). In a group of CML patients resistant to IMA, when compared with IMA-sensitive CML patients, a decrease in SCD-1 gene expression levels and an increase in BCL-2 gene expression levels was observed. In this case, the SCD-1 gene was thought to act as a tumor suppressor. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms involved in IMA resistance in CML patients and determine new targets that can be beneficial in choosing the effective treatment. Finally, the study suggests that the SCD-1 and BCL-2 genes may be mechanisms responsible for resistance.", "pmid": "36660357"}

We investigated whether 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a PKC activator, reduced the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and explored the involvement of the Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivator YAP. We analyzed the effect of TPA on the proliferation and expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) in the LX-2 HSC line. We also analyzed the phosphorylation of the Hippo pathway molecules YAP and LATS1 and investigated YAP nuclear translocation. We examined whether Go 6983, a pan-PKC inhibitor, restored the TPA-inhibited activities of HSCs. Administration of TPA decreased the growth rate of LX-2 cells and inhibited the expression of alpha-SMA and collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1). In addition, TPA induced phosphorylation of PKCdelta, LATS1, and YAP and inhibited the nuclear translocation of YAP compared with the control. These TPA-induced phenomena were mostly ameliorated by Go 6983. Our results indicate that PKCdelta exerts an antifibrotic effect by inhibiting the Hippo pathway in HSCs.

Selective blockade of serotonin-6 (5-HT6) receptors, which are exclusively localized to the central nervous system, is reported to play an important role in learning and memory. Masupirdine is a potent and selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist with pro-cognitive properties in animal models of cognition. METHODS: The efficacy and safety of masupirdine were evaluated in patients with moderate AD concurrently treated with donepezil and memantine. A total of 564 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio. The study consisted of a 26-week double-blind treatment period. The primary efficacy outcome was the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog 11). Changes from baseline were analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). In exploratory post hoc analyses, patients were subdivided based on the use of memantine dosage forms and memantine plasma concentrations, to evaluate the impact of memantine on the efficacy of masupirdine. RESULTS: In an exploratory post hoc analysis, less worsening in cognition (ADAS-Cog 11 scores) was observed with masupirdine treatment as compared with placebo in patients whose trough memantine plasma concentrations were <= 100 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Although prespecified study endpoints of the phase 2 study were not met, these exploratory post hoc subgroup observations are hypothesis-generating and suggest that the efficacy of masupirdine was adversely affected by concurrent therapy with memantine. Further assessment of masupirdine to determine its potential role as a treatment option for cognitive deficits associated with AD is warranted.

Here we aim to study whether two receptors from RAS, the angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1R) and the bradykinin 2 receptor (B2R) modulate ACE2 internalization induced by a recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Also, we investigated the impact of ACE2 coexpression on AT1R and B2R functionality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To study ACE2 internalization, we assessed the distribution of green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal in HEK293T cells coexpressing GFP-tagged ACE2 and AT1R, or B2R, or AT1R plus B2R in presence of RBD alone or in combination with AT1R or B2R ligands. To estimate ACE2 internalization, we classified GFP signal distribution as plasma membrane uniform GFP (PMU-GFP), plasma membrane clustered GFP (PMC-GFP) or internalized GFP and calculated its relative frequency. Additionally, we investigated the effect of ACE2 coexpression on AT1R and B2R inhibitory action on voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) currents by patch-clamp technique. KEY FINDINGS: RBD induced ACE2-GFP internalization in a time-dependent manner. RBD-induced ACE2-GFP internalization was increased by angiotensin II and reduced by telmisartan in cells coexpressing AT1R. RBD-induced ACE2-GFP internalization was strongly inhibited by B2R co-expression. This effect was mildly modified by bradykinin and rescued by angiotensin II in presence of AT1R. ACE2 coexpression impacted on B2R- and AT1R-mediated inhibition of CaV2.2 currents.

However, the insufficient immune response caused by inefficient immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers and thermal resistance, immunosuppression, and immune escape resulting from the hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors severely limit its efficacy. Herein, we report an ultrasound and laser-promoted dual-gas nano-generator (calcium carbonate-polydopamine-manganese oxide nanoparticles, CPM NPs) for enhanced photothermal/immune tumor therapy through reprogramming tumor hypoxic microenvironment. In this system, CPM NPs undergo reactive decomposition in a moderately acidic tumor, resulting in the generation of calcium, manganese ions, carbon dioxide (CO2), and oxygen (O2). Calcium and manganese ions act as adjuvants that trigger an immune response. The cancer cell membrane rupture caused by sudden burst of bubbles (CO2 and O2) under ultrasound stimulation and the photothermal properties of PDA also contributed to the ICD effect. The generation of O2 alleviates tumor hypoxia and thus reduces hypoxia-induced heat resistance and immunosuppressive effects, thereby improving the therapeutic efficacy of combination PTT and immune therapy.

Two key subunits, Muskelin and Wdr26, specify two alternative CTLH complexes that differ in quaternary structure, thereby allowing the E3 ligase to presumably target different substrates. With the aid of different biophysical and biochemical techniques we characterized CTLH complex assembly pathways, focusing not only on Wdr26 and Muskelin, but also on the RanBP9, Twa1 and Armc8beta subunits, which are critical to establish the scaffold of this E3 ligase. We demonstrate that the ability of Muskelin to tetramerize and the assembly of Wdr26 into dimers define mutually exclusive oligomerization modules that compete with nanomolar affinity for RanBP9 binding. The remaining scaffolding subunits, Armc8beta and Twa1, strongly interact with each other and with RanBP9, again with nanomolar affinity. Our data demonstrate that RanBP9 organizes subunit assembly and prevents higher order oligomerization of dimeric Wdr26 and the Armc8beta-Twa1 heterodimer through its tight binding.

It has been shown that both BPA and BPS affect the number of enteric neurons containing substance P (SP), galanin (GAL), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS-a marker of nitrergic neurons) and/or vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT- a marker of cholinergic neurons). The changes noted under the impact of both bisphenols are similar and consisted of an increase in the number of enteric neurons immunoreactive to all neuronal factors studied. The impact of BPS on some populations of neurons was stronger than that noted under the influence of BPA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The lentivirus particles of oe-PTPRM, sh-PTPRM, oe-FN1, sh-FN1, or their negative controls (NSCs) were transfected into GBM cells with or without stattic (0.5 muM, 24 h) or 5-aza (1 muM, 0, 2, 4 h) treatments. Methylation-specific PCR was performed to detect PTPRM methylation levels. RESULTS: PTPRM was down-regulated (0.373 +- 0.124- and 0.455 +- 0.109-fold), FN1 and p-STAT3 were up-regulated (p < 0.001) in A172 and U87 MG cells as compared to NSCs. Overexpressing PTPRM inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation. Interfering with PTPRM increased colony numbers in A172 and U-87 MG cells (2.253 +- 0.111- and 2.043 +- 0.19-fold), and stattic reduced them. Cell viability was reduced after treatment with 5-aza in A172 and U-87 MG cells (p < 0.05). P-STAT3 was down-regulated after 5-aza treatment.
